However, emphasis on potential differences between music and language may discourage a consideration of the commonalities that music and literature share. Indeed, one possibility is that common mechanisms underlie their affective impact, and the current paper carefully reviews relevant neuroscientific findings to examine such a prospect. First and foremost, it will be demonstrated that considerable evidence of a common role of empathy and predictive processes now exists for the two domains. However, it will also be noted that an important open question remains: namely, whether the mechanisms underlying the subjective experience of uncertainty differ between the two domains with respect to recruitment of phylogenetically ancient emotion areas. It will be concluded that a comparative approach may not only help to reveal general mechanisms underlying our responses to music and literature, but may also help us better understand any idiosyncrasies in their capacity for affective impact.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Diana Omigie","author_id":2282812803,"num_publications":38,"num_citations":526,"affiliation_name":"Max Planck Society","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":1905662862,"node_type":"seed","size":1525,"connected_edge_ids":["1905662862-2002907081"],"connected_node_ids":[2002907081],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":1978549608,"pmid":"22023743","pmcid":"3480649","doi":"10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.10.004"},"title":"The history of the future of the Bayesian brain","year":2012,"published_date":"2012-08-15","journal":"NeuroImage","abstract":"The slight perversion of the original title of this piece (The Future of the Bayesian Brain) reflects my attempt to write prospectively about ‘Science and Stories’ over the past 20years. I will meet this challenge by dealing with the future and then turning to its history. The future of the Bayesian brain (in neuroimaging) is clear: it is the application of dynamic causal modeling to understand how the brain conforms to the free energy principle. In this context, the Bayesian brain is a corollary of the free energy principle, which says that any self organizing system (like a brain or neuroimaging community) must maximize the evidence for its own existence, which means it must minimize its free energy using a model of its world. Dynamic causal modeling involves finding models of the brain that have the greatest evidence or the lowest free energy. In short, the future of imaging neuroscience is to refine models of the brain to minimize free energy, where the brain refines models of the world to minimize free energy. This endeavor itself minimizes free energy because our community is itself a self organizing system. I cannot imagine an alternative future that has the same beautiful self consistency as mine.

This conclusion is based on the following arguments: if the coupling among an ensemble of dynamical systems is mediated by short-range forces, then the states of remote systems must be conditionally independent. These independencies induce a Markov blanket that separates internal and external states in a statistical sense. The existence of a Markov blanket means that internal states will appear to minimize a free energy functional of the states of their Markov blanket. Crucially, this is the same quantity that is optimized in Bayesian inference. Therefore, the internal states (and their blanket) will appear to engage in active Bayesian inference. In other words, they will appear to model—and act on—their world to preserve their functional and structural integrity, leading to homoeostasis and a simple form of autopoiesis.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Karl J.

This property of “perceptual presence” has motivated “sensorimotor theories” which understand perception to involve the mastery of sensorimotor contingencies. However, the mechanistic basis of sensorimotor contingencies and their mastery has remained unclear. Sensorimotor theory also struggles to explain instances of perception, such as synesthesia, that appear to lack perceptual presence and for which relevant sensorimotor contingencies are difficult to identify. On alternative “predictive processing” theories, perceptual content emerges from probabilistic inference on the external causes of sensory signals, however, this view has addressed neither the problem of perceptual presence nor synesthesia. Here, I describe a theory of predictive perception of sensorimotor contingencies which (1) accounts for perceptual presence in normal perception, as well as its absence in synesthesia, and (2) operationalizes the notion of sensorimotor contingencies and their mastery. The core idea is that generative models underlying perception incorporate explicitly counterfactual elements related to how sensory inputs would change on the basis of a broad repertoire of possible actions, even if those actions are not performed. These “counterfactually-rich” generative models encode sensorimotor contingencies related to repertoires of sensorimotor dependencies, with counterfactual richness determining the degree of perceptual presence associated with a stimulus. While the generative models underlying normal perception are typically counterfactually rich (reflecting a large repertoire of possible sensorimotor dependencies), those underlying synesthetic concurrents are hypothesized to be counterfactually poor. In addition to accounting for the phenomenology of synesthesia, the theory naturally accommodates phenomenological differences between a range of experiential states including dreaming, hallucination, and the like. It may also lead to a new view of the (in)determinacy of normal perception.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Anil K.

In Hobson, Hong and Friston (2014) these include an innate virtual reality generator that produces the fictive prior beliefs that Freud described as the primary process. This enables Friston’s account to encompass a unified treatment – a complexity theory – of the role of virtual reality in both dreaming and mental disorder. In both accounts the brain operates to minimize FE aroused by sensory impingements -- including interoceptive impingements that report compliance with biological imperatives -- and constructs a representation/model of the causes of impingement that enables this minimization. In Friston’s account (variational) FE equals complexity minus accuracy, and is minimized by increasing accuracy and decreasing complexity. Roughly the brain (or model) increases accuracy together with complexity in waking. This is mediated by consciousness-creating active inference – by which it explains sensory impingements in terms of perceptual experiences of their causes. In sleep it reduces complexity by processes that include both synaptic pruning and consciousness/virtual reality/dreaming in REM. The consciousness-creating active inference that effects complexity-reduction in REM dreaming must operate on FE-arousing data distinct from sensory impingement. The most relevant source is remembered arousals of emotion, both recent and remote, as processed in SWS and REM on ‘active systems’ accounts of memory consolidation/reconsolidation. Freud describes these remembered arousals as condensed in the dreamwork for use in the conscious contents of dreams, and similar condensation can be seen in symptoms. Complexity partly reflects emotional conflict and trauma. This indicates that dreams and symptoms are both produced to reduce complexity in the form of potentially adverse (traumatic or conflicting) arousals of amygdala-related emotions. Mental disorder is thus caused by computational complexity together with the mechanisms like synaptic pruning that have evolved for complexity-reduction; and important features of disorder can be understood in these terms. Details of the consilience among Freudian, systems consolidation, and complexity-reduction accounts appear clearly in the analysis of a single fragment of a dream, indicating also how complexity reduction proceeds by a process resembling Bayesian","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Jim Hopkins","author_id":2919117362,"num_publications":39,"num_citations":500,"affiliation_name":"King's College London","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2464934902,"node_type":"seed","size":1750,"connected_edge_ids":["2464934902-2040834369","2464934902-1418557530","2464934902-2128918015","2464934902-2123611655","2986921757-2464934902","2757038055-2464934902","3138514317-2464934902","2963142467-2464934902","2809773754-2464934902","2931034662-2464934902"],"connected_node_ids":[2040834369,1418557530,2128918015,2123611655,2986921757,2757038055,3138514317,2963142467,2809773754,2931034662],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2470855507,"pmid":"27445895","pmcid":"4915327","doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00925"},"title":"Toward a Unified Sub-symbolic Computational Theory of Cognition.","year":2016,"published_date":"2016-06-21","journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","abstract":"This paper proposes how various disciplinary theories of cognition may be combined into a unifying, sub-symbolic, computational theory of cognition. The following theories are considered for integration: psychological theories, including the theory of event coding, event segmentation theory, the theory of anticipatory behavioral control, and concept development; artificial intelligence and machine learning theories, including reinforcement learning and generative artificial neural networks; and theories from theoretical and computational neuroscience, including predictive coding and free energy-based inference. In the light of such a potential unification, it is discussed how abstract cognitive, conceptualized knowledge and understanding may be learned from actively gathered sensorimotor experiences. The unification rests on the free energy-based inference principle, which essentially implies that the brain builds a predictive, generative model of its environment. Neural activity-oriented inference causes the continuous adaptation of the currently active predictive encodings. Neural structure-oriented inference causes the longer term adaptation of the developing generative model as a whole. Finally, active inference strives for maintaining internal homeostasis, causing goal-directed motor behavior. To learn abstract, hierarchical encodings, however, it is proposed that free energy-based inference needs to be enhanced with structural priors, which bias cognitive development towards the formation of particular, behaviorally suitable encoding structures. As a result, it is hypothesized how abstract concepts can develop from, and thus how they are structured by and grounded in, sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, it is sketched-out how symbol-like thought can be generated by a temporarily active set of predictive encodings, which constitute a distributed neural attractor in the form of an interactive free-energy minimum. The activated, interactive network attractor essentially characterizes the semantics of a concept or a concept composition, such as an actual or imagined situation in our environment. Temporal successions of attractors then encode unfolding semantics, which may be generated by a behavioral or mental interaction with an actual or imagined situation in our environment. Implications, further predictions, possible verification and falsifications, as well as potential enhancements into a fully spelled-out unified theory of cognition are discussed at the end of the paper.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Martin V.

The answer is a brain-based, computational account called the theory of constructed emotion.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Lisa Feldman Barrett","author_id":2168418084,"num_publications":415,"num_citations":42676,"affiliation_name":"Toronto General Hospital","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2538626945,"node_type":"seed","size":1750,"connected_edge_ids":["2538626945-2033422410","2538626945-1418557530","3217145890-2538626945","3188501181-2538626945","3096810469-2538626945","3097148807-2538626945","3210700158-2538626945","2682853549-2538626945","3196481983-2538626945","2931034662-2538626945"],"connected_node_ids":[2033422410,1418557530,3217145890,3188501181,3096810469,3097148807,3210700158,2682853549,3196481983,2931034662],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2682853549,"pmid":null,"pmcid":"6566209","doi":"10.1007/s11023-017-9441-6"},"title":"Predictive Processing and the Representation Wars","year":2018,"published_date":"2018-01-01","journal":"Minds and Machines","abstract":"Clark has recently suggested that predictive processing advances a theory of neural function with the resources to put an ecumenical end to the “representation wars” of recent cognitive science.

The answer is yes. So there you have it – the answer is yes. This was my response to a question I was asked to address in a recent AEON piece (https://aeon.co/essays/consciousness-is-not-a-thing-but-a-process-of-inference). What follows is based upon the notes for that essay, with a special focus on self-organisation, self-evidencing and self-modelling. I will try to substantiate my (polemic) answer from the perspective of a physicist. In brief, the argument goes as follows: if we want to talk about creatures, like ourselves, then we have to identify the characteristic behaviours they must exhibit. This is fairly easy to do by noting that living systems return to a set of attracting states time and time again. Mathematically, this implies the existence of a Lyapunov function that turns out to be model evidence (i.e., self-evidence) in Bayesian statistics or surprise (i.e., self-information) in information theory. This means that all biological processes can be construed as performing some form of inference, from evolution through to conscious processing. If this is the case, at what point do we invoke consciousness? The proposal on offer here is that the mind comes into being when self-evidencing has a temporal thickness or counterfactual depth, which grounds inferences about the consequences of my action. On this view, consciousness is nothing more than inference about my future; namely, the self-evidencing consequences of what I could do.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Karl J.

Over the course of his career, Freud variously described conflict as an opposition to the discharge of activation (1950), opposition to psychic activity due to the release of unpleasure (1900/1991), opposition between the primary principle and the reality principle (1911), structural conflict between id, ego and superego (1923/1961), and ambivalence (1912/1963). Besides this difficulty of the shifting description of conflict, an underlying question remained the specific shared terrain in which emotions, thoughts, intentions or wishes could come into conflict with one another (the neuronal homologue of conflict), and most especially how they may exist as quantities in opposition within that terrain. Friston’s free-energy principle (FEP henceforth) connected to the work of Professor Karl Friston (Friston, 2010; Friston, Kilner & Harrison, 2006) has provided the potential for a powerful unifying theory in psychology, neuroscience and related fields that has been shown to have tremendous consilience with psychoanalytic concepts (Hopkins, 2012). Hopkins (2016), drawing on a formulation by Hobson, Hong and Friston (2014), suggests that conflict may be potentially quantifiable as free energy from a FEP perspective. More recently, work by Friston, FitzGerald, Rigoli, Schwartenbeck and Pezzulo (2017) has framed the selection of action as a gradient descent of expected free energy under different policies of action. From this perspective, the article describes how conflict could potentially be formalized as a situation where opposing action policies have similar expected free energy, for example between actions driven by competing basic prototype emotion systems as described by Panksepp (1998). This conflict state may be avoided in the future through updating the relative precision of a particular set of prior beliefs about outcomes: this has the result of tending to favour one of the policies of action over others in future instances, a situation analogous to defense. Through acting as a constraint on the further development of the person, the defensive operation can become entrenched, and resistant to alteration. The implications that this formalization has for psychoanalysis is explored.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Connolly","author_id":2760784985,"num_publications":6,"num_citations":24,"affiliation_name":"Hong Kong Shue Yan University","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2809773754,"node_type":"seed","size":1750,"connected_edge_ids":["2986921757-2809773754","2963142467-2809773754","3120002157-2809773754","2809773754-2424475825","2809773754-2606488938","2809773754-2464934902","2809773754-2757038055","2809773754-2796263488","2809773754-2122458046","2809773754-2055789905"],"connected_node_ids":[2986921757,2963142467,3120002157,2424475825,2606488938,2464934902,2757038055,2796263488,2122458046,2055789905],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2903264717,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3389/fnint.2018.00061"},"title":"Formalizing the Function of Anterior Insula in Rapid Adaptation.","year":2018,"published_date":"2018-12-04","journal":"Frontiers in Integrative Neuroscience","abstract":"Anterior Insula (AI) is thought to play a crucial role in rapid adaptation in an ever-changing environment.

Risk and surprise only enter to the extent that they modulate the learning rate, and even without such modulation, adaptation will still be effective, albeit slow. Here, I propose a new theory of learning, Reference-Model Based Learning (RMBL), where risk and surprise are central, and prediction errors play a secondary, though still crucial, role. Choices in a target location prediction task where participants were continuously required to adapt appeared to be consistent with model predictions.

Taking the case of visuomotor control, we consider a minimal control problem that is how select the next saccade, in a sequence of discrete eye movements, when the final objective is to better interpret the current visual scene. The visual scene is modeled here as a partially-observed environment, with a generative model explaining how the visual data is shaped by action. This allows to interpret different action selection metrics proposed in the literature, including the Salience, the Infomax and the Variational Free Energy, under a single information theoretic construct, namely the view-based Information Gain. Pursuing this analytic track, two original action selection metrics named the Information Gain Lower Bound (IGLB) and the Information Gain Upper Bound (IGUB) are then proposed. Showing either a conservative or an optimistic bias regarding the Information Gain, they strongly simplify its calculation. An original fovea-based visual scene decoding setup is then proposed, with numerical experiments highlighting different facets of artificial fovea-based vision. A first and principal result is that state-of-the-art recognition rates are obtained with fovea-based saccadic exploration, using less than 10% of the original image's data. Those satisfactory results illustrate the advantage of mixing predictive control with accurate state-of-the-art predictors, namely a deep neural network. A second result is the sub-optimality of some classical action-selection metrics widely used in literature, that is not manifest with finely-tuned inference models, but becomes patent when coarse or faulty models are used. Last, a computationally-effective predictive model is developed using the IGLB objective, with pre-processed visual scan-path read-out from memory, bypassing computationally-demanding predictive calculations. This last simplified setting is shown effective in our case, showing both a competing accuracy and a good robustness to model flaws.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Emmanuel Daucé","author_id":2304335563,"num_publications":43,"num_citations":184,"affiliation_name":"Aix-Marseille University","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2904920389,"node_type":"seed","size":1550,"connected_edge_ids":["2904920389-2059156134","3134399927-2904920389"],"connected_node_ids":[2059156134,3134399927],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2904972128,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/e20120942"},"title":"Morphological Computation: Nothing but Physical Computation.","year":2018,"published_date":"2018-12-07","journal":"Entropy","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to argue against the claim that morphological computation is substantially different from other kinds of physical computation.

EFE involves a version of Shannon Entropy parameterised by relationships. It turns out that, for systems with bias due to learning, certain choices for the relationship parameters are isolated since giving much lower EFE values than others and, hence, the system defines relationships. It is proposed that, in the context of all these relationships, a brain state acquires meaning in the form of the relational content of the associated experience. EFE minimisation is itself an association learning process and its effectiveness as such is tested in this article. The theory and results are consistent with the proposition of there being a close connection between association learning processes and the emergence of consciousness.

Task-based studies of NCC by their nature recruit one part of the cortical network to study another, and are therefore both limited and compromised in what they can reveal about consciousness itself. The form of consciousness explored in such research, we term the human default consciousness (DCs), our everyday waking consciousness. In contrast, studies of anaesthesia, coma, deep sleep, or some extreme pathological states such as epilepsy, reveal very different cortical activity; all of which states are essentially involuntary, and generally regarded as “unconscious”. An exception to involuntary disruption of consciousness is Buddhist jhāna meditation, whose implicit aim is to intentionally withdraw from the default consciousness, to an inward-directed state of stillness referred to as jhāna consciousness, as a basis to develop insight. The default consciousness is sensorily-based, where information about, and our experience of, the outer world is evaluated against personal and organic needs and forms the basis of our ongoing self-experience. This view conforms both to Buddhist models, and to the emerging work on active inference and minimisation of free energy in determining the network balance of the human default consciousness. This paper is a preliminary report on the first detailed EEG study of jhāna meditation, with findings radically different to studies of more familiar, less focused forms of meditation. While remaining highly alert and “present” in their subjective experience, a high proportion of subjects display “spindle” activity in their EEG, superficially similar to sleep spindles of stage 2 nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage slow-waves reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deeper stage 4 nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma. Some others show brief posterior spike-wave bursts, again similar, but with significant differences, to absence epilepsy. Some subjects also develop the ability to consciously evoke clonic seizure-like activity at will, under full control. We suggest that the remarkable nature of these observations reflects a profound disruption of the human DCs when the personal element is progressively withdrawn.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"P.

Despite these major advancements, we do not know the mechanisms connecting neuronal and mental states, the neuro-mental mechanisms that allow transforming neuronal activity into mental states. We propose that neuroscience may benefit from the kind of Copernican turn that, initiated by Copernicus and Darwin, revolutionized the fields of physics and biology. Specifically, I claim that we need to abandon our currently rather anthropocentric ‘vantage point from within brain’ by a more allo-centric ‘vantage point from beyond brain’. I first show how Copernicus and Darwin, due to the shift of their vantage point from within to beyond earth and humans, were able to take into view the non-specialness of earth and humans, e.g., what is shared between earth and other planets as well as between human and non-human species. Such specialness is still presupposed in current neuroscience which regards the neural correlates of mental features like consciousness that are supposed to be special when compared to those of non-mental features. That is possible only by presupposing a pre-Copernican ‘vantage point from within brain’. Recent data as illustrated in this paper, show a neuronal continuum between conscious and unconscious states; that defies the supposed specialness of the neuronal mechanisms underlying mental features. Mental features like consciousness may then signify rather a specific degree on a broader neuronal continuum that ranges from non-consciousness over unconsciousness and consciousness to extended consciousness. The neuronal mechanisms underlying mental features can then be characterized by non-specialness (rather than specialness) which presupposes a ‘vantage point from beyond brain’. Such vantage point from beyond brain, in turn, allows taking into view the shared features between neuronal and mental features, i.e., their “common currency”. That same “common currency” may, in turn, allow addressing and searching for those mechanisms that allow transforming neuronal activity into mental states, e.g., neuro-mental transformation. In conclusion, I propose that neuroscience may benefit in its search for the neural basis of mind from a Copernican turn analogous to the one initiated by Copernicus and Darwin in physics and biology.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Georg Northoff","author_id":1288706717,"num_publications":666,"num_citations":20769,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2970708184,"node_type":"seed","size":1625,"connected_edge_ids":["2970708184-2534098824","2970708184-2905018743","2970708184-2800982817","2970708184-2884852581","2970708184-2115460576"],"connected_node_ids":[2534098824,2905018743,2800982817,2884852581,2115460576],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2978972729,"pmid":"31636594","pmcid":"6787636","doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02267"},"title":"The Predictive Processing Model of EMDR","year":2019,"published_date":"2019-10-04","journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","abstract":"Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR) is an effective treatment for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The Adaptive Information Processing Model (AIP) guides the development and practice of EMDR. The AIP postulates inadequately processed memory as the foundation of PTSD pathology. Predictive Processing postulates that the primary function of the brain is prediction that serves to anticipate the next moment of experience in order to resist the dissipative force of entropy thus facilitating continued survival. Memory is the primary substrate of prediction, and is optimized by an ongoing process of precision weighted prediction error minimization that refines prediction by updating the memories on which it is based. The Predictive Processing model of EMDR postulates that EMDR facilitates the predictive processing of traumatic memory by overcoming the bias against exploration and evidence accumulation. The EMDR protocol brings the traumatic memory into an active state of re-experiencing. Defensive responding and/or low sensory precision preclude evidence accumulation to test the predictions of the traumatic memory in the present. Sets of therapist guided eye movements repeatedly challenge the bias against evidence accumulation and compel sensory sampling of the benign present. Eye movements reset the theta rhythm organizing the flow of information through the brain, facilitating the deployment of both overt and covert attention, and the mnemonic search for associations. Sampling of sensation does not support the predictions of the traumatic memory resulting in prediction error that the brain then attempts to minimize. The net result is a restoration of the integrity of the rhythmic deployment of attention, a recalibration of sensory precision, and the updating (reconsolidation) of the traumatic memory. Thus one prediction of the model is a decrease in Attention Bias Variability, a core dysfunction in PTSD, following successful treatment with EMDR.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"D.

The significance of such objects in psychoanalysis is that they may be superimposed on current experience so that perceptions are partly composed of projected fantasy, and partly of more realistic perception. From a free energy perspective, the psychoanalytic (person) object may be understood as a bounded set of prior beliefs about a ‘platonic’ sort of person, that provides a free energy minimising, evidence maximising, hypothesis to explain inference about – or dyadic interactions with – another. The degree to which realistic perception supervenes - relative to a platonic person object - will depend upon the precision assigned to the sensory evidence (concerning the person) relative to the prior beliefs about a platonic form. This not only provides a basis for explaining projection and transference phenomena, but also for conceptualizing a central assumption within object relations psychoanalysis. As an example, the paper examines the Kleinian theory of split good or bad part-objects as affectively-organized generative models (or platonic part-object models) formed in early infancy. This also provides a basis for building on work by Kernberg (1984, 1996) by conceptualizing the role of the part-object(s) in a continuum of reality testing, from mild errors in perception that are relatively easily corrected, through borderline affective instability and frequent shifts between part-object experience, to psychotic failures of reality testing, where Friston, Brown, Siemerkus & Stephan (2016) propose that aberrant precisions bias perception to high precision false beliefs (here cast as platonic part-objects), such as stable perceptions of others (and possibly oneself) as persecutory agents of some sort. The paper demonstrates the value that the history of clinical insights in psychoanalysis (including object relations) and a systems-based approach to the brain (including the free energy principle) can have for one another. This is offered as a demonstration of the potential value of an ‘Integrative Clinical Systems Psychology’ proposed by Tretter and Lӧffler-Stastka (2018) which has the potential to integrate the major theoretical frameworks in the field today.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Connolly","author_id":2760784985,"num_publications":6,"num_citations":24,"affiliation_name":"Hong Kong Shue Yan University","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2986921757,"node_type":"seed","size":1725,"connected_edge_ids":["2986921757-2901597764","2986921757-2908555537","2986921757-2952777976","2986921757-2464934902","2986921757-2802036381","2986921757-2757038055","2986921757-2809773754","2986921757-1975979465","2986921757-2017794063"],"connected_node_ids":[2901597764,2908555537,2952777976,2464934902,2802036381,2757038055,2809773754,1975979465,2017794063],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2988114478,"pmid":"31920779","pmcid":"6923654","doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02688"},"title":"The Computational Boundary of a \"Self\": Developmental Bioelectricity Drives Multicellularity and Scale-Free Cognition.","year":2019,"published_date":"2019-12-13","journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","abstract":"All epistemic agents physically consist of parts that must somehow comprise an integrated cognitive self. Biological individuals consist of subunits (organs, cells, molecular networks) that are themselves complex and competent in their own context. How do coherent biological Individuals result from the activity of smaller sub-agents? To understand the evolution and function of metazoan bodies and minds, it is essential to conceptually explore the origin of multicellularity and the scaling of the basal cognition of individual cells into a coherent larger organism. In this paper I synthesize ideas in cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and developmental physiology toward a hypothesis about the origin of Individuality: “Scale-Free Cognition”. I propose a fundamental definition of an Individual based on the ability to pursue goals at an appropriate level of scale and organization, and suggest a formalism for defining and comparing the cognitive capacities of highly diverse types of agents. Any Self is demarcated by a computational surface – the spatio-temporal boundary of events that it can measure, model, and try to affect. This surface sets a functional boundary - a cognitive “light cone” which defines the scale and limits of its cognition. I hypothesize that higher-level goal-directed activity and agency, resulting in larger cognitive boundaries, evolve from the primal homeostatic drive of living things to reduce stress – the difference between current conditions and life-optimal conditions. The mechanisms of developmental bioelectricity - the ability of all cells to form electrical networks that process information - suggests a plausible set of gradual evolutionary steps that naturally lead from physiological homeostasis in single cells to memory, prediction, and ultimately complex cognitive agents, via scale-up of the drive of infotaxis. Recent data on the molecular mechanisms of pre-neural bioelectricity suggest a model of how increasingly sophisticated cognitive functions emerge smoothly from cell-cell communication used to guide embryogenesis and regeneration. This set of hypotheses provides a novel perspective on numerous phenomena, such as cancer, and makes several unique, testable predictions for interdisciplinary research that have implications not only for evolutionary developmental biology but also for biomedicine and perhaps artificial intelligence and exobiology.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Michael Levin","author_id":2527624094,"num_publications":1725,"num_citations":53946,"affiliation_name":"Worldwide Universities Network","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2988114478,"node_type":"seed","size":1525,"connected_edge_ids":["3188501181-2988114478"],"connected_node_ids":[3188501181],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3022054609,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/e22050536"},"title":"Inferring What to Do (And What Not to).","year":2020,"published_date":"2020-05-11","journal":"Entropy","abstract":"In recent years, the “planning as inference” paradigm has become central to the study of behaviour.

These are rooted in optimal experimental design, information theory, and statistical decision making. We unpack how these factors imply a functional architecture for motivated behaviour. This raises an important question: how can we put this architecture to work in the service of understanding observed neurobiological structure? To answer this question, we draw from established techniques in experimental studies of behaviour. Typically, these examine the influence of perturbations of the nervous system—which include pathological insults or optogenetic manipulations—to see their influence on behaviour. Here, we argue that the message passing that emerges from inferring what to do can be similarly perturbed. If a given perturbation elicits the same behaviours as a focal brain lesion, this provides a functional interpretation of empirical findings and an anatomical grounding for theoretical results. We highlight examples of this approach that influence different sorts of goal-directed behaviour, active learning, and decision making.

Although many existing robotics studies use a forward model framework, there are generalization issues with high degrees of freedom. The current study shows that the predictive coding (PC) and active inference (AIF) frameworks, which employ a generative model, can develop better generalization by learning a prior distribution in a low dimensional latent state space representing probabilistic structures extracted from well habituated sensory-motor trajectories. In our proposed model, learning is carried out by inferring optimal latent variables as well as synaptic weights for maximizing the evidence lower bound, while goal-directed planning is accomplished by inferring latent variables for maximizing the estimated lower bound. Our proposed model was evaluated with both simple and complex robotic tasks in simulation, which demonstrated sufficient generalization in learning with limited training data by setting an intermediate value for a regularization coefficient. Furthermore, comparative simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms a conventional forward model in goal-directed planning, due to the learned prior confining the search of motor plans within the range of habituated trajectories.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Takazumi Matsumoto","author_id":2790041727,"num_publications":7,"num_citations":25,"affiliation_name":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Jun Tani","author_id":3025182784,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":2,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":2},{"name":"Jun Tani","author_id":1989802913,"num_publications":286,"num_citations":4861,"affiliation_name":"Waseda University","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3025794913,"node_type":"seed","size":1575,"connected_edge_ids":["3025794913-2787984105","3025794913-2137411342","3025794913-2783657280"],"connected_node_ids":[2787984105,2137411342,2783657280],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3035420228,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3389/frai.2020.00030"},"title":"An Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) of Consciousness: Combining Integrated Information and Global Neuronal Workspace Theories With the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework; Toward Solving the Hard Problem and Characterizing Agentic Causation.","year":2020,"published_date":"2020-06-09","journal":null,"abstract":"The Free Energy Principle and Active Inference Framework (FEP-AI) begins with the understanding that thermodynamically-open systems must regulate environmental exchanges and prevent entropic accumulation. In FEP-AI, minds and brains are predictive controllers for autonomous systems, where action-driven perception is realized as probabilistic inference. Integrated Information Theory (IIT) begins with considering the preconditions for a system to intrinsically exist, as well as axioms regarding the nature of consciousness. IIT has produced controversy because of its surprising entailments: quasi-panpsychism; subjectivity without referents or dynamics; and the possibility of fully-intelligent-yet-unconscious brain simulations. Here, I describe how these controversies might be resolved by integrating IIT with FEP-AI, where integrated information only entails consciousness for systems with perspectival reference frames capable of generating models with spatial, temporal, and causal coherence for self and world. Without that connection with external reality, systems could have arbitrarily high amounts of integrated information, but nonetheless would not entail subjective experience. I further describe how an integration of these frameworks may contribute to their evolution as unified systems theories and models of emergent causation. Then, inspired by both Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT) and the Harmonic Brain Modes framework, I describe how streams of consciousness may emerge as an evolving generation of sensorimotor predictions, with the precise composition of experiences depending on the integration abilities of synchronous complexes as self-organizing harmonic modes (SOHMs). These integrating dynamics may be particularly likely to occur via richly connected subnetworks affording body-centric sources of phenomenal binding and executive control. Along these connectivity backbones, SOHMs are proposed to implement loopy message passing (cf. turbo-codes) over predictive (autoencoding) networks, so generating maximum a posteriori estimates as coherent vectors governing neural evolution, with alpha frequencies generating basic awareness, and cross-frequency phase-coupling within theta frequencies for access consciousness and volitional control. These dynamic cores of integrated information also function as global workspaces, centered on posterior cortices, but capable of being entrained with frontal cortices and interoceptive hierarchies, so affording agentic causation. Integrated World Modeling Theory (IWMT) represents a synthetic approach to understanding minds that reveals compatibility between leading theories of consciousness, so enabling inferential synergy.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Adam Safron","author_id":1972922091,"num_publications":52,"num_citations":705,"affiliation_name":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3035420228,"node_type":"seed","size":1800,"connected_edge_ids":["3131787597-3035420228","3196481983-3035420228","3207057898-3035420228","3173661405-3035420228","3035420228-2807844797","3035420228-2754844655","3035420228-2783657280","3035420228-2606488938","3035420228-2901597764","3035420228-2989729815","3035420228-2908555537","3035420228-2623066203","3035420228-2004652753","3035420228-2905334783","3035420228-2943260997","3035420228-1979732124","3035420228-2797051230","3035420228-2793764002","3035420228-2055789905","3035420228-2122458046","3035420228-2033422410","3035420228-2802036381"],"connected_node_ids":[3131787597,3196481983,3207057898,3173661405,2807844797,2754844655,2783657280,2606488938,2901597764,2989729815,2908555537,2623066203,2004652753,2905334783,2943260997,1979732124,2797051230,2793764002,2055789905,2122458046,2033422410,2802036381],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3038817743,"pmid":"32633715","pmcid":"7392608","doi":"10.7554/elife.53262"},"title":"Dopamine role in learning and action inference.","year":2020,"published_date":"2020-07-07","journal":"eLife","abstract":"This paper describes a framework for modelling dopamine function in the mammalian brain.

I will argue that information generation should not be regarded as a sufficient condition for consciousness, but could serve as what I will call a \"minimal unifying model of consciousness.\" A minimal unifying model (MUM) specifies at least one necessary feature of consciousness, characterizes it in a determinable way, and shows that it is entailed by (many) existing theories of consciousness. Information generation fulfills these requirements. A MUM of consciousness is useful, because it unifies existing theories of consciousness by highlighting their common assumptions, while enabling further developments from which empirical predictions can be derived. Unlike existing theories (which probably contain at least some false assumptions), a MUM is thus likely to be an adequate model of consciousness, albeit at a relatively general level. Assumptions embodied in such a model are less informative than assumptions made by more specific theories and hence function more in the way of guiding principles. Still, they enable further refinements, in line with new empirical results and broader theoretical and evolutionary considerations. This also allows developing the model in ways that facilitate more specific claims and predictions.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Wanja Wiese","author_id":2109458674,"num_publications":31,"num_citations":225,"affiliation_name":"University of Mainz","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3041332494,"node_type":"seed","size":1600,"connected_edge_ids":["3041332494-2033422410","3041332494-2014054116","3041332494-2606488938","3207057898-3041332494"],"connected_node_ids":[2033422410,2014054116,2606488938,3207057898],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3096646250,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2020.549187"},"title":"Variational Free Energy and Economics Optimizing With Biases and Bounded Rationality","year":2020,"published_date":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to offer a new framework for understanding action, optimization and choice when applied to economic theory more generally.

A key component of this hierarchical processing system, and hub of affective self-modeling is activity in the anterior insula cortex. I defend the account by applying it to the phenomenon of pain asymbolia, a condition in which nociceptive signals (of bodily damage) are not attributed to the self. Thus pain asymbolia is a form of “depersonalisation for pain” as Klein puts it. The pain is experienced as happening to my body but is not experienced as mine.

The current study shows that the predictive coding (PC) and active inference (AIF) frameworks, which employ a generative model, can develop better generalization by learning a prior distribution in a low dimensional latent state space representing probabilistic structures extracted from well habituated sensory-motor trajectories. In our proposed model, learning is carried out by inferring optimal latent variables as well as synaptic weights for maximizing the evidence lower bound, while goal-directed planning is accomplished by inferring latent variables for maximizing the estimated lower bound. Our proposed model was evaluated with both simple and complex robotic tasks in simulation, which demonstrated sufficient generalization in learning with limited training data by setting an intermediate value for a regularization coefficient. Furthermore, comparative simulation results show that the proposed model outperforms a conventional forward model in goal-directed planning, due to the learned prior confining the search of motor plans within the range of habituated trajectories.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Takazumi Matsumoto","author_id":2790041727,"num_publications":7,"num_citations":25,"affiliation_name":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Jun Tani","author_id":1989802913,"num_publications":286,"num_citations":4861,"affiliation_name":"Waseda University","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3103942687,"node_type":"seed","size":1650,"connected_edge_ids":["3103942687-2787984105","3103942687-2783657280","3103942687-2137411342","3134192892-3103942687","3134399927-3103942687","3155071252-3103942687"],"connected_node_ids":[2787984105,2783657280,2137411342,3134192892,3134399927,3155071252],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3107960514,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2020.607917"},"title":"An Algorithmic Metaphysics of Self-Patterns","year":2020,"published_date":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","abstract":"the paper draws some criteria from algorithmic complexity to demonstrate that the self (as initially described in Shaun Gallagher’s a pattern theory of self) is a composite, scattered, and patterned object.

The two approaches vary in scope and methodology. The scope of cognitivist predictive processing is narrow and restricts cognition to brain processes and structures; it does not consider the body-beyond-brain and the environment as constituents of cognitive processes. Free energy enactivism, on the other hand, includes all self-organizing systems that minimize free energy (including non-living systems) and thus does not offer any unique explanations for more complex cognitive phenomena that are unique to human cognition. Furthermore, because of its strong commitment to the mind-life continuity thesis, it does not provide an explanation of what distinguishes more sophisticated cognitive systems from simple systems.

Specifically, it shows that this philosophical interpretation of the FEP argues circularly and only delivers what it initially assumes, i.e., a dual information geometry that allegedly explains epistemic access to the world based on prior dual assumptions. The origin of this circularity can be traced back to a physical description contingent on relative system-environment separation. However, the FEP itself is not committed to MM, and as a scientific theory it delivers more than what it assumes, serving as a heuristic unification principle that provides epistemic advancement for the life sciences.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Javier Sánchez-Cañizares","author_id":2050924692,"num_publications":63,"num_citations":74,"affiliation_name":"University of Navarra","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Javier Sánchez-Cañizares","author_id":3130448107,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":1,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3131787597,"node_type":"seed","size":1725,"connected_edge_ids":["3131787597-3048600682","3131787597-2055789905","3131787597-2783657280","3131787597-3035420228","3131787597-2095648136","3131787597-2909444209","3131787597-2976973594","3131787597-2953421850","3131787597-2682853549"],"connected_node_ids":[3048600682,2055789905,2783657280,3035420228,2095648136,2909444209,2976973594,2953421850,2682853549],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3139867012,"pmid":"33810573","pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/e23040396"},"title":"Multiscale Free Energy Analysis of Human Ecosystem Engineering.","year":2021,"published_date":null,"journal":"Entropy","abstract":"Unlike ecosystem engineering by other living things, which brings a relatively limited range of sensations that are connected to a few enduring survival preferences, human ecosystem engineering brings an increasing variety and frequency of novel sensations.

For many models, these self-evidencing dynamics manifest as messages passed among elements of a system. Such messages resemble synaptic communication at a neuronal network level but could also apply to other network structures. This paper attempts to apply the same formulation to biochemical networks. The chemical computation that occurs in regulation of metabolism relies upon sparse interactions between coupled reactions, where enzymes induce conditional dependencies between reactants. We will see that these reactions may be viewed as the movement of probability mass between alternative categorical states. When framed in this way, the master equations describing such systems can be reformulated in terms of their steady-state distribution. This distribution plays the role of a generative model, affording an inferential interpretation of the underlying biochemistry.

This capacity goes far beyond that of a simple entrained oscillator, drawing on contextual and enculturated timing expectations and adjusting rapidly to perturbations in event timing, phase, and tempo. Previous modeling work has described how entrainment to rhythms may be shaped by event timing expectations, but sheds little light on any underlying computational principles that could unify the phenomenon of expectation-based entrainment with other brain processes. Inspired by the predictive processing framework, we propose that the problem of rhythm tracking is naturally characterized as a problem of continuously estimating an underlying phase and tempo based on precise event times and their correspondence to timing expectations. We present two inference problems formalizing this insight: PIPPET (Phase Inference from Point Process Event Timing) and PATIPPET (Phase and Tempo Inference). Variational solutions to these inference problems resemble previous \"Dynamic Attending\" models of perceptual entrainment, but introduce new terms representing the dynamics of uncertainty and the influence of expectations in the absence of sensory events. These terms allow us to model multiple characteristics of covert and motor human rhythm tracking not addressed by other models, including sensitivity of error corrections to inter-event interval and perceived tempo changes induced by event omissions. We show that positing these novel influences in human entrainment yields a range of testable behavioral predictions. Guided by recent neurophysiological observations, we attempt to align the phase inference framework with a specific brain implementation. We also explore the potential of this normative framework to guide the interpretation of experimental data and serve as building blocks for even richer predictive processing and active inference models of timing.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Jonathan Cannon","author_id":2303401242,"num_publications":20,"num_citations":265,"affiliation_name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3169988421,"node_type":"seed","size":1550,"connected_edge_ids":["3169988421-1979732124","3169988421-3086777466"],"connected_node_ids":[1979732124,3086777466],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3173661405,"pmid":"34202965","pmcid":"8234656","doi":"10.3390/e23060783"},"title":"The Radically Embodied Conscious Cybernetic Bayesian Brain: From Free Energy to Free Will and Back Again.","year":2021,"published_date":"2021-06-20","journal":"Entropy","abstract":"Drawing from both enactivist and cognitivist perspectives on mind, I propose that explaining teleological phenomena may require reappraising both “Cartesian theaters” and mental homunculi in terms of embodied self-models (ESMs), understood as body maps with agentic properties, functioning as predictive-memory systems and cybernetic controllers. Quasi-homuncular ESMs are suggested to constitute a major organizing principle for neural architectures due to their initial and ongoing significance for solutions to inference problems in cognitive (and affective) development. Embodied experiences provide foundational lessons in learning curriculums in which agents explore increasingly challenging problem spaces, so answering an unresolved question in Bayesian cognitive science: what are biologically plausible mechanisms for equipping learners with sufficiently powerful inductive biases to adequately constrain inference spaces? Drawing on models from neurophysiology, psychology, and developmental robotics, I describe how embodiment provides fundamental sources of empirical priors (as reliably learnable posterior expectations). If ESMs play this kind of foundational role in cognitive development, then bidirectional linkages will be found between all sensory modalities and frontal-parietal control hierarchies, so infusing all senses with somatic-motoric properties, thereby structuring all perception by relevant affordances, so solving frame problems for embodied agents. Drawing upon the Free Energy Principle and Active Inference framework, I describe a particular mechanism for intentional action selection via consciously imagined (and explicitly represented) goal realization, where contrasts between desired and present states influence ongoing policy selection via predictive coding mechanisms and backward-chained imaginings (as self-realizing predictions). This embodied developmental legacy suggests a mechanism by which imaginings can be intentionally shaped by (internalized) partially-expressed motor acts, so providing means of agentic control for attention, working memory, imagination, and behavior. I further describe the nature(s) of mental causation and self-control, and also provide an account of readiness potentials in Libet paradigms wherein conscious intentions shape causal streams leading to enaction. Finally, I provide neurophenomenological handlings of prototypical qualia including pleasure, pain, and desire in terms of self-annihilating free energy gradients via quasi-synesthetic interoceptive active inference. In brief, this manuscript is intended to illustrate how radically embodied minds may create foundations for intelligence (as capacity for learning and inference), consciousness (as somatically-grounded self-world modeling), and will (as deployment of predictive models for enacting valued goals).","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Adam Safron","author_id":1972922091,"num_publications":52,"num_citations":705,"affiliation_name":"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3173661405,"node_type":"seed","size":1800,"connected_edge_ids":["3173661405-3096810469","3173661405-2055789905","3173661405-2807844797","3173661405-2781668895","3173661405-3134192892","3173661405-2115460576","3173661405-2802947734","3173661405-2803735852","3173661405-2905334783","3173661405-2095648136","3173661405-2171916839","3173661405-3035420228","3173661405-2787984105","3173661405-2002907081","3173661405-2033422410","3173661405-2123611655","3173661405-2024149692","3173661405-2208959019","3173661405-2765383588","3173661405-2754844655","3173661405-3173571222","3173661405-1979732124","3173661405-2004652753","3173661405-2484983710","3173661405-2036228275","3173661405-2797051230","3173661405-2783657280","3173661405-2080654992","3173661405-2953421850"],"connected_node_ids":[3096810469,2055789905,2807844797,2781668895,3134192892,2115460576,2802947734,2803735852,2905334783,2095648136,2171916839,3035420228,2787984105,2002907081,2033422410,2123611655,2024149692,2208959019,2765383588,2754844655,3173571222,1979732124,2004652753,2484983710,2036228275,2797051230,2783657280,2080654992,2953421850],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3174849351,"pmid":"34202804","pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/e23070806"},"title":"Psychomotor Predictive Processing.","year":2021,"published_date":"2021-06-24","journal":"Entropy","abstract":"Psychomotor experience can be based on what people predict they will experience, rather than on sensory inputs.

First, by going beyond previous studies that have encompassed embodied cognition but have not addressed some fundamental aspects of psychomotor functioning. Second, by proposing a scientific basis for explaining predictive processing that spans objective neuroscience and subjective experience. Third, by providing an explanation of predictive processing that can be incorporated into the planning and operation of systems involving robots and other new technologies. This is necessary because such systems are becoming increasingly common and move us farther away from the hunter-gatherer lifestyles within which our psychomotor functioning evolved. For example, beliefs that workplace robots are threatening can generate anxiety, while wearing hardware, such as augmented reality headsets and exoskeletons, can impede the natural functioning of psychomotor systems.

Integrated Information Theory represents a pioneering attempt to do just this. This theory accounts for the core features of consciousness by holding that there is an equivalence between the phenomenal experience associated with a system and its intrinsic causal power. The proposal, however, fails to provide insight into the qualitative character of consciousness and, as a result of its proposed equivalence between consciousness and purely internal dynamics, into the intentional character of conscious perception. In recent years, an alternate group of theories has been proposed that claims consciousness to be equivalent to certain forms of inference. One such theory is the Living Mirror theory, which holds consciousness to be a form of inference performed by all living systems. The proposal of consciousness as inference overcomes the shortcomings of Integrated Information Theory, particularly in the case of conscious perception. A synthesis of these two perspectives can be reached by appreciating that conscious living systems are self-organising in nature. This mode of organization requires them to have a high level of integration. From this perspective, we can understand consciousness as being dependent on a system possessing non-trivial amounts of integrated information while holding that the process of inference performed by the system is the fact of consciousness itself.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"James E.

It remains unclear, however, whether predictive processing is equipped to accommodate a theory of consciousness itself. Furthermore, objectors have argued that without specification of the core computational mechanisms of consciousness, predictive processing is unable to inform the attribution of consciousness to other non-human (biological and artificial) systems. In this paper, I argue that an account of consciousness in the predictive brain is within reach via recent accounts of phenomenal self-modelling in the active inference framework. The central claim here is that phenomenal consciousness is underpinned by 'subjective valuation'-a deep inference about the precision or 'predictability' of the self-evidencing ('fitness-promoting') outcomes of action. Based on this account, I argue that this approach can critically inform the distribution of experience in other systems, paying particular attention to the complex sensory attenuation mechanisms associated with deep self-models. I then consider an objection to the account: several recent papers argue that theories of consciousness that invoke self-consciousness as constitutive or necessary for consciousness are undermined by states (or traits) of 'selflessness'; in particular the 'totally selfless' states of ego-dissolution occasioned by psychedelic drugs. Drawing on existing work that accounts for psychedelic-induced ego-dissolution in the active inference framework, I argue that these states do not threaten to undermine an active inference theory of consciousness. Instead, these accounts corroborate the view that subjective valuation is the constitutive facet of experience, and they highlight the potential of psychedelic research to inform consciousness science, computational psychiatry and computational phenomenology.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"George Deane","author_id":3013366915,"num_publications":5,"num_citations":34,"affiliation_name":"University of Edinburgh","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3196481983,"node_type":"seed","size":1800,"connected_edge_ids":["3196481983-2151496011","3196481983-1975979465","3196481983-2781668895","3196481983-3017990858","3196481983-3049709870","3196481983-2606488938","3196481983-2953421850","3196481983-2989729815","3196481983-2789154098","3196481983-2664609681","3196481983-3035420228","3196481983-2148544865","3196481983-2782189646","3196481983-3096810469","3196481983-2002907081","3196481983-2787984105","3196481983-2789196295","3196481983-2802947734","3196481983-2115460576","3196481983-2551311960","3196481983-2033422410","3196481983-2765383588","3196481983-2537237778","3196481983-2905334783","3196481983-2802036381","3196481983-2905018743","3196481983-3108742966","3196481983-2538626945","3196481983-2949457836","3196481983-1418557530","3196481983-2908555537"],"connected_node_ids":[2151496011,1975979465,2781668895,3017990858,3049709870,2606488938,2953421850,2989729815,2789154098,2664609681,3035420228,2148544865,2782189646,3096810469,2002907081,2787984105,2789196295,2802947734,2115460576,2551311960,2033422410,2765383588,2537237778,2905334783,2802036381,2905018743,3108742966,2538626945,2949457836,1418557530,2908555537],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3198666034,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/e23091155"},"title":"Future-Proofing Startups: Stress Management Principles Based on Adaptive Calibration Model and Active Inference Theory.","year":2021,"published_date":"2021-09-02","journal":"Entropy","abstract":"In this paper, the Adaptive Calibration Model (ACM) and Active Inference Theory (AIT) are related to future-proofing startups. ACM encompasses the allocation of energy by the stress response system to alternative options for action, depending upon individuals’ life histories and changing external contexts. More broadly, within AIT, it is posited that humans survive by taking action to align their internal generative models with sensory inputs from external states. The first contribution of the paper is to address the need for future-proofing methods for startups by providing eight stress management principles based on ACM and AIT. Future-proofing methods are needed because, typically, nine out of ten startups do not survive. A second contribution is to relate ACM and AIT to startup life cycle stages. The third contribution is to provide practical examples that show the broader relevance ACM and AIT to organizational practice. These contributions go beyond previous literature concerned with entrepreneurial stress and organizational stress. In particular, rather than focusing on particular stressors, this paper is focused on the recalibrating/updating of startups’ stress responsivity patterns in relation to changes in the internal state of the startup and/or changes in the external state. Overall, the paper makes a contribution to relating physics of life constructs concerned with energy, action and ecological fitness to human organizations.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Stephen Fox","author_id":2120149736,"num_publications":61,"num_citations":690,"affiliation_name":"VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3198666034,"node_type":"seed","size":1750,"connected_edge_ids":["3198666034-3174849351","3198666034-2564601941","3198666034-2890724683","3198666034-3139867012","3198666034-2793764002","3198666034-2953421850","3198666034-1180102735","3198666034-2884852581","3198666034-3128268019","3213807182-3198666034"],"connected_node_ids":[3174849351,2564601941,2890724683,3139867012,2793764002,2953421850,1180102735,2884852581,3128268019,3213807182],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3204374301,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/e23101306"},"title":"Dynamic Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Estimation of Linear Systems with Colored Noise.","year":2021,"published_date":"2021-01-01","journal":"Entropy","abstract":"The free energy principle from neuroscience has recently gained traction as one of the most prominent brain theories that can emulate the brain’s perception and action in a bio-inspired manner.

Before effective treatments, countering the spread of these infections depends on mitigating, protective behaviours such as social distancing, respecting lockdown, wearing masks, frequent handwashing, travel restrictions, and vaccine acceptance. Previous work has shown that the enacting protective behaviours depends on beliefs about individual vulnerability, threat severity, and one's ability to engage in such protective actions. However, little is known about the genesis of these beliefs in response to an infectious disease epidemic, and the cognitive mechanisms that may link these beliefs to decision making. Active inference (AI) is a recent approach to behavioural modelling that integrates embodied perception, action, belief updating, and decision making. This approach provides a framework to understand the behaviour of agents in situations that require planning under uncertainty. It assumes that the brain infers the hidden states that cause sensations, predicts the perceptual feedback produced by adaptive actions, and chooses actions that minimize expected surprise in the future. In this paper, we present a computational account describing how individuals update their beliefs about the risks and thereby commit to protective behaviours. We show how perceived risks, beliefs about future states, sensory uncertainty, and outcomes under each policy can determine individual protective behaviours. We suggest that these mechanisms are crucial to assess how individuals cope with uncertainty during a pandemic, and we show the interest of these new perspectives for public health policies.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Hugo Bottemanne","author_id":3026546815,"num_publications":21,"num_citations":54,"affiliation_name":"University of Paris","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

To do this, I consider a distributed factorization of a group’s optimization of free energy, in which each agent is attempting to align with the group and with its own model. I show how this can lead to equilibria for groups, defined by the capacity of the model being used, essentially how many different datasets it can handle. In particular, I show that there is a “sweet spot” in the capacity of a normal model in each agent’s decentralized optimization, and that this “sweet spot” corresponds to minimal free energy for the group. At the sweet spot, an agent can predict what the group will do and the group is not surprised by the agent. However, there is an asymmetry. A higher capacity model for an agent makes it harder for the individual to learn, as there are more parameters. Simultaneously, a higher capacity model for the group, implemented as a higher capacity model for each member agent, makes it easier for a group to integrate a new member. To optimize for a group of agents then requires one to make a trade-off in capacity, as each individual agent seeks to decrease capacity, but there is pressure from the group to increase capacity of all members. This pressure exists because as individual agent’s capacities are reduced, so too are their abilities to model other agents, and thereby to establish pro-social behavioural patterns. I then consider a basic two-level (dual process) Bayesian model of social reasoning and a set of three parameters of capacity that are required to implement such a model. Considering these three capacities as dependent elements in a free energy minimization for a group leads to a “sweet surface” in a three-dimensional space defining the triplet of parameters that each agent must use should they hope to minimize free energy as a group. Finally, I relate these three parameters to three notions of freedom and equality in human social organization, and postulate a correspondence between freedom and model capacity. That is, models with higher capacity, have more freedom as they can interact with more datasets.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Jesse Hoey","author_id":2114254494,"num_publications":174,"num_citations":5463,"affiliation_name":"University of Waterloo","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Jesse Hoey","author_id":3210786244,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":1,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3209658298,"node_type":"seed","size":1500,"connected_edge_ids":[],"connected_node_ids":[],"cluster_id":5,"alternate_cluster_id":0},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3213807182,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/e23111521"},"title":"Accessing Active Inference Theory through Its Implicit and Deliberative Practice in Human Organizations","year":2021,"published_date":"2021-11-15","journal":"Entropy","abstract":"Active inference theory (AIT) is a corollary of the free-energy principle, which formalizes cognition of living system’s autopoietic organization.

In this article, I argue that these approaches adhere to an essentialist view of learning that avoids the question why information seeking should be favorable in the first place. I propose a selectionist account of adaptive behavior that explains why individuals behave as if they had a tendency to seek information without resorting to essentialist explanations. I develop my argument using a formal selectionist framework for adaptive behavior, the multilevel model of behavioral selection (MLBS). The MLBS has been introduced recently as a formal theory of behavioral selection that links reinforcement learning to natural selection within a single unified model. I show that the MLBS implies an average gain in information about the availability of reinforcement. Formally, this means that behavior reaches an equilibrium state, if and only if the Fisher information of the conditional probability of reinforcement is maximized. This coincides with a reduction in the randomness of the expected environmental feedback as captured by the information theoretic concept of expected surprise (i.e., entropy). The main result is that behavioral selection maximizes the information about the expected fitness consequences of behavior, which, in turn, minimizes average surprise. In contrast to existing attempts to link adaptive behavior to information theoretic concepts (e.g., the free energy principle), neither information gain nor surprise minimization is treated as a first principle. Instead, the result is formally deduced from the MLBS and therefore constitutes a mathematical property of the more general principle of behavioral selection. Thus, if reinforcement learning is understood as a selection process, there is no need to assume an active agent with an innate tendency to seek information or minimize surprise. Instead, information gain and surprise minimization emerge naturally because it lies in the very nature of selection to produce order from randomness.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Matthias Borgstede","author_id":2979798531,"num_publications":8,"num_citations":7,"affiliation_name":"University of Bamberg","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3217532074,"node_type":"seed","size":1525,"connected_edge_ids":["3217532074-2908555537"],"connected_node_ids":[2908555537],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":4200589761,"pmid":"34946007","pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/e23121701"},"title":"Permutation Entropy as a Universal Disorder Criterion: How Disorders at Different Scale Levels Are Manifestations of the Same Underlying Principle.","year":2021,"published_date":"2021-12-20","journal":"Entropy","abstract":"What do bacteria, cells, organs, people, and social communities have in common? At first sight, perhaps not much. They involve totally different agents and scale levels of observation. On second thought, however, perhaps they share everything. A growing body of literature suggests that living systems at different scale levels of observation follow the same architectural principles and process information in similar ways. Moreover, such systems appear to respond in similar ways to rising levels of stress, especially when stress levels approach near-lethal levels. To explain such communalities, we argue that all organisms (including humans) can be modeled as hierarchical Bayesian controls systems that are governed by the same biophysical principles. Such systems show generic changes when taxed beyond their ability to correct for environmental disturbances. Without exception, stressed organisms show rising levels of 'disorder' (randomness, unpredictability) in internal message passing and overt behavior. We argue that such changes can be explained by a collapse of allostatic (high-level integrative) control, which normally synchronizes activity of the various components of a living system to produce order. The selective overload and cascading failure of highly connected (hub) nodes flattens hierarchical control, producing maladaptive behavior. Thus, we present a theory according to which organic concepts such as stress, a loss of control, disorder, disease, and death can be operationalized in biophysical terms that apply to all scale levels of organization. Given the presumed universality of this mechanism, 'losing control' appears to involve the same process anywhere, whether involving bacteria succumbing to an antibiotic agent, people suffering from physical or mental disorders, or social systems slipping into warfare. On a practical note, measures of disorder may serve as early warning signs of system failure even when catastrophic failure is still some distance away.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Rutger Goekoop","author_id":4202369246,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":0,"affiliation_name":"ASSIA","sequence_number":0},{"name":"Roy de Kleijn","author_id":2020730521,"num_publications":21,"num_citations":283,"affiliation_name":"Leiden University","sequence_number":1}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":4200589761,"node_type":"seed","size":1500,"connected_edge_ids":[],"connected_node_ids":[],"cluster_id":6,"alternate_cluster_id":0},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":1180102735,"pmid":"26275633","pmcid":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.bandc.2015.08.002"},"title":"The role of interoceptive inference in theory of mind","year":2017,"published_date":"2017-03-01","journal":"Brain and Cognition","abstract":"Abstract   Inferring the intentions and beliefs of another is an ability that is fundamental for social and affiliative interactions.

This paper shows how such a mapping may be established, even if the biologically motion is visually perceived from a new vantage point. We introduce a learning artificial neural network model and evaluate it on full body motion tracking recordings. The model implements an embodied, predictive inference approach. It first learns to correlate and segment multimodal sensory streams of own bodily motion. In doing so, it becomes able to anticipate motion progression, to complete missing modal information, and to self-generate learned motion sequences. When biological motion of another person is observed, this self-knowledge is utilized to recognize similar motion patterns and predict their progress. Due to the relative encodings, the model shows strong robustness in recognition despite observing rather large varieties of body morphology and posture dynamics. By additionally equipping the model with the capability to rotate its visual frame of reference, it is able to deduce the visual perspective onto the observed person, establishing full consistency to the embodied self-motion encodings by means of active inference. In further support of its neuro-cognitive plausibility, we also model typical bistable perceptions when crucial depth information is missing. In sum, the introduced neural model proposes a solution to the problem of how the human brain may establish correspondence between observed bodily motion and its own motor system, thus offering a mechanism that supports the development of mirror neurons.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Fabian Schrodt","author_id":2046647071,"num_publications":14,"num_citations":62,"affiliation_name":"University of Tübingen","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Georg Layher","author_id":111200659,"num_publications":38,"num_citations":519,"affiliation_name":"University of Ulm","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Heiko Neumann","author_id":2195296034,"num_publications":310,"num_citations":4313,"affiliation_name":"University of Ulm","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Martin V.

It has been used to demonstrate that the brain learns the statistical structure of its environment and predicts future sensory inputs. However, the algorithmic nature of these computations and the underlying neurobiological implementation remain controversial. This article introduces a mathematical framework with which competing ideas about the computational quantities indexed by MMN responses can be formalized and tested against single-trial EEG data. This framework was applied to five major theories of the MMN, comparing their ability to explain trial-by-trial changes in MMN amplitude. Three of these theories (predictive coding, model adjustment, and novelty detection) were formalized by linking the MMN to different manifestations of the same computational mechanism: approximate Bayesian inference according to the free-energy principle. We thereby propose a unifying view on three distinct theories of the MMN. The relative plausibility of each theory was assessed against empirical single-trial MMN amplitudes acquired from eight healthy volunteers in a roving oddball experiment. Models based on the free-energy principle provided more plausible explanations of trial-by-trial changes in MMN amplitude than models representing the two more traditional theories (change detection and adaptation). Our results suggest that the MMN reflects approximate Bayesian learning of sensory regularities, and that the MMN-generating process adjusts a probabilistic model of the environment according to prediction errors.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Falk Lieder","author_id":2142775165,"num_publications":68,"num_citations":1517,"affiliation_name":"Max Planck Society","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Jean Daunizeau","author_id":1276936747,"num_publications":137,"num_citations":12251,"affiliation_name":"University of Paris","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Marta I.

We suggest that inferred representations of the self have a normative function: to predict and optimise the likely outcomes of social interactions. Technically, we cast this predict-and-optimise as maximising the chance of favourable outcomes through active inference. Here the utility of outcomes can be conceptualised as prior beliefs about final states. Actions based on interpersonal representations can therefore be understood as minimising surprise – under the prior belief that one will end up in states with high utility. Interpersonal representations thus serve to render interactions more predictable, while the affective valence of interpersonal inference renders self-perception evaluative. Distortions of self-representation contribute to major psychiatric disorders such as depression, personality disorder and paranoia.

It is characterized by remarkably large spontaneous modulations. Here, we review evidence for the functional role of these ongoing activity fluctuations and argue that they constitute an essential property of the neural architecture underlying cognition. The role of spontaneous activity fluctuations is probably best understood when considering both their spatiotemporal structure and their functional impact on cognition. We first briefly argue against a “segregationist” view on ongoing activity, both in time and space, which would selectively associate certain frequency bands or levels of spatial organization with specific functional roles. Instead, we emphasize the functional importance of the full range, from differentiation to integration, of intrinsic activity within a hierarchical spatiotemporal structure. We then highlight the flexibility and context-sensitivity of intrinsic functional connectivity that suggest its involvement in functionally relevant information processing. This role in information processing is pursued by reviewing how ongoing brain activity interacts with afferent and efferent information exchange of the brain with its environment. We focus on the relationship between the variability of ongoing and evoked brain activity, and review recent reports that tie ongoing brain activity fluctuations to variability in human perception and behavior. Finally, these observations are discussed within the framework of the free-energy principle which – applied to human brain function – provides a theoretical account for a non-random, coordinated interaction of ongoing and evoked activity in perception and behavior.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Sepideh Sadaghiani","author_id":2082872745,"num_publications":53,"num_citations":2598,"affiliation_name":"University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Guido Hesselmann","author_id":1984291022,"num_publications":74,"num_citations":2259,"affiliation_name":"Charité","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Karl J.

Here, we present an alternative view that frames the physiology of dopamine in terms of Bayes-optimal behaviour. In this account, dopamine controls the precision or salience of (external or internal) cues that engender action. In other words, dopamine balances bottom-up sensory information and top-down prior beliefs when making hierarchical inferences (predictions) about cues that have affordance. In this paper, we focus on the consequences of changing tonic levels of dopamine firing using simulations of cued sequential movements. Crucially, the predictions driving movements are based upon a hierarchical generative model that infers the context in which movements are made. This means that we can confuse agents by changing the context (order) in which cues are presented. These simulations provide a (Bayes-optimal) model of contextual uncertainty and set switching that can be quantified in terms of behavioural and electrophysiological responses. Furthermore, one can simulate dopaminergic lesions (by changing the precision of prediction errors) to produce pathological behaviours that are reminiscent of those seen in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. We use these simulations to demonstrate how a single functional role for dopamine at the synaptic level can manifest in different ways at the behavioural level.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Karl J.

However, the volumes of research have almost exclusively focused on its evolutionary origins, development, and neurobiological bases, as well as how the experience of empathy is modulated by social context and interpersonal relationships. In the present paper, we examine a much less attended side of empathy: why it has a positive impact on others? After specifying what the construct of empathy encompasses, we briefly review the various effects of empathy on health outcomes in the domain of medicine. We then propose two non-mutually exclusive mechanistic explanations that contribute to explain the positive effects of physician empathy on patients. 1) The social baseline theory, building on social support research, proposes that the presence of other people helps individuals to conserve metabolically costly somatic and neural resources through the social regulation of emotion. 2) The free energy principle postulates that the brain optimizes a (free energy) bound on surprise or its complement value to respond to environmental changes adaptively. These conceptualizations can be combined to provide a unifying integrative account of the benefits of physicians’ empathetic attitude on their patients and how it plays a role in healing beyond the mere effect of the therapeutic alliance.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Jean Decety","author_id":159486211,"num_publications":392,"num_citations":46609,"affiliation_name":"French Institute of Health and Medical Research","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Aikaterini Fotopoulou","author_id":2400189706,"num_publications":157,"num_citations":4132,"affiliation_name":"University College London","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":1979983483,"node_type":"seed","size":1525,"connected_edge_ids":["1979983483-2084235460"],"connected_node_ids":[2084235460],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":1981905332,"pmid":"22013413","pmcid":"3190184","doi":"10.3389/fnsys.2011.00080"},"title":"Free energy and dendritic self-organization.","year":2011,"published_date":"2011-10-11","journal":"Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience","abstract":"In this paper, we pursue recent observations that, through selective dendritic filtering, single neurons respond to specific sequences of presynaptic inputs. We try to provide a principled and mechanistic account of this selectivity by applying a recent free-energy principle to a dendrite that is immersed in its neuropil or environment. We assume that neurons self-organize to minimize a variational free-energy bound on the self-information or surprise of presynaptic inputs that are sampled. We model this as a selective pruning of dendritic spines that are expressed on a dendritic branch. This pruning occurs when postsynaptic gain falls below a threshold. Crucially, postsynaptic gain is itself optimized with respect to free energy. Pruning suppresses free energy as the dendrite selects presynaptic signals that conform to its expectations, specified by a generative model implicit in its intracellular kinetics. Not only does this provide a principled account of how neurons organize and selectively sample the myriad of potential presynaptic inputs they are exposed to, but it also connects the optimization of elemental neuronal (dendritic) processing to generic (surprise or evidence-based) schemes in statistics and machine learning, such as Bayesian model selection and automatic relevance determination.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Stefan J.

Specifically, we consider delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filtering to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalised coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalised coordinates provides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. The efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of pursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the generative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements--in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally, the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can recognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from different sources with different temporal delays and the particular difficulties encountered when a system--like the oculomotor system--tries to control its environment with delayed signals.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Perrinet","author_id":2017857339,"num_publications":141,"num_citations":2219,"affiliation_name":"Centre national de la recherche scientifique","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Rick A.

Despite the inextricable link between emotion and cognition, emotion has not yet been formulated under this framework. A core concept that permeates many perspectives on emotion is valence, which broadly refers to the positive and negative character of emotion or some of its aspects. In the present paper, we propose a definition of emotional valence in terms of the negative rate of change of free-energy over time. If the second time-derivative of free-energy is taken into account, the dynamics of basic forms of emotion such as happiness, unhappiness, hope, fear, disappointment and relief can be explained. In this formulation, an important function of emotional valence turns out to regulate the learning rate of the causes of sensory inputs. When sensations increasingly violate the agent's expectations, valence is negative and increases the learning rate. Conversely, when sensations increasingly fulfil the agent's expectations, valence is positive and decreases the learning rate. This dynamic interaction between emotional valence and learning rate highlights the crucial role played by emotions in biological agents' adaptation to unexpected changes in their world.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Mateus Joffily","author_id":1261972901,"num_publications":50,"num_citations":1628,"affiliation_name":"Centre national de la recherche scientifique","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Giorgio Coricelli","author_id":337471541,"num_publications":127,"num_citations":3532,"affiliation_name":"École Normale Supérieure","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2002907081,"node_type":"seed","size":1800,"connected_edge_ids":["3207097194-2002907081","3049709870-2002907081","2014114527-2002907081","2796263488-2002907081","2945567094-2002907081","2921499788-2002907081","2992533179-2002907081","1180102735-2002907081","2757038055-2002907081","1905662862-2002907081","3108742966-2002907081","3096810469-2002907081","2789154098-2002907081","3023496026-2002907081","3097148807-2002907081","2069432145-2002907081","2002907081-2137411342","2002907081-1979732124","2754844655-2002907081","3196481983-2002907081","3173661405-2002907081","2975220955-2002907081","2908555537-2002907081","2787984105-2002907081"],"connected_node_ids":[3207097194,3049709870,2014114527,2796263488,2945567094,2921499788,2992533179,1180102735,2757038055,1905662862,3108742966,3096810469,2789154098,3023496026,3097148807,2069432145,2137411342,1979732124,2754844655,3196481983,3173661405,2975220955,2908555537,2787984105],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2004652753,"pmid":"25957007","pmcid":"4502445","doi":"10.1016/j.cortex.2015.03.025"},"title":"Active inference, communication and hermeneutics.","year":2015,"published_date":"2015-07-01","journal":"Cortex","abstract":"Hermeneutics refers to interpretation and translation of text (typically ancient scriptures) but also applies to verbal and non-verbal communication. In a psychological setting it nicely frames the problem of inferring the intended content of a communication. In this paper, we offer a solution to the problem of neural hermeneutics based upon active inference. In active inference, action fulfils predictions about how we will behave (e.g., predicting we will speak). Crucially, these predictions can be used to predict both self and others – during speaking and listening respectively. Active inference mandates the suppression of prediction errors by updating an internal model that generates predictions – both at fast timescales (through perceptual inference) and slower timescales (through perceptual learning). If two agents adopt the same model, then – in principle – they can predict each other and minimise their mutual prediction errors. Heuristically, this ensures they are singing from the same hymn sheet. This paper builds upon recent work on active inference and communication to illustrate perceptual learning using simulated birdsongs. Our focus here is the neural hermeneutics implicit in learning, where communication facilitates long-term changes in generative models that are trying to predict each other. In other words, communication induces perceptual learning and enables others to (literally) change our minds and vice versa.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Karl J.

The key difference between these accounts is that predictions are sensitive to the current proprioceptive context, whereas efference copy is not. Using functional electric stimulation to experimentally manipulate proprioception during voluntary movement in healthy human subjects, we assessed the evidence for context sensitive output from M1. Dynamic causal modeling of functional magnetic resonance imaging responses showed that FES altered proprioception increased the influence of M1 on primary somatosensory cortex (S1). These results disambiguate competing accounts of motor control, provide some insight into the synaptic mechanisms of sensory attenuation and may speak to potential mechanisms of action of FES in promoting motor learning in neurorehabilitation.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Marta Gandolla","author_id":2013034002,"num_publications":62,"num_citations":1241,"affiliation_name":"Polytechnic University of Milan","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Simona Ferrante","author_id":2132812223,"num_publications":187,"num_citations":2108,"affiliation_name":"Polytechnic University of Milan","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Franco Molteni","author_id":2671343052,"num_publications":246,"num_citations":2594,"affiliation_name":"University of Padua","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Eleonora Guanziroli","author_id":2463014467,"num_publications":46,"num_citations":662,"affiliation_name":"University of Brescia","sequence_number":4},{"name":"T.

It has been suggested that the free energy principle precludes novelty and complexity, because it assumes that biological systems – like ourselves - try to minimise the long-term average of surprise to maintain their homeostasis. However, recent formulations show that minimising surprise leads naturally to concepts such as exploration and novelty bonuses. In this approach, agents infer a policy that minimises surprise by minimising the difference (or relative entropy) between likely and desired outcomes, which involves both pursuing the goal-state that has the highest expected utility (often termed ‘exploitation’) and visiting a number of different goal-states (‘exploration’). Crucially, the opportunity to visit new states increases the value of the current state. Casting decision-making problems within a variational framework, therefore, predicts that our behaviour is governed by both the entropy and expected utility of future states. This dissolves any dialectic between minimising surprise and exploration or novelty seeking.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Schwartenbeck","author_id":1840493039,"num_publications":36,"num_citations":1936,"affiliation_name":"Max Planck Society","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas H.

Social cognition, however, entails special challenges. We address these challenges through a novel formulation of a formal model and demonstrate its psychological significance. Method: We review relevant literature, especially with regards to interpersonal representations, formulate a mathematical model and present a simulation study. The model accommodates normative models from utility theory and places them within the broader setting of Bayesian inference. Crucially, we endow people's prior beliefs, into which utilities are absorbed, with preferences of self and others. The simulation illustrates the model's dynamics and furnishes elementary predictions of the theory. Results: 1. Because beliefs about self and others inform both the desirability and plausibility of outcomes, in this framework interpersonal representations become beliefs that have to be actively inferred. This inference, akin to 'mentalising' in the psychological literature, is based upon the outcomes of interpersonal exchanges. 2. We show how some well-known social-psychological phenomena (e.g. self-serving biases) can be explained in terms of active interpersonal inference. 3. Mentalising naturally entails Bayesian updating of how people value social outcomes. Crucially this includes inference about one’s own qualities and preferences. Conclusion: We inaugurate a Bayes optimal framework for modelling intersubject variability in mentalising during interpersonal exchanges. Here, interpersonal representations are endowed with explicit functional and affective properties. We suggest the active inference framework lends itself to the study of psychiatric conditions where mentalising is distorted.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Michael Moutoussis","author_id":2558443771,"num_publications":121,"num_citations":2496,"affiliation_name":"Murphy Oil","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Nelson J.

It is based on the premise that our sensations are largely generated by other agents like ourselves. This means, we are trying to infer how our sensations are caused by others, while they are trying to infer our behaviour: for example, in the dialogue between two speakers. We suggest that the infinite regress induced by modelling another agent – who is modelling you – can be finessed if you both possess the same model. In other words, the sensations caused by others and oneself are generated by the same process. This leads to a view of communication based upon a narrative that is shared by agents who are exchanging sensory signals. Crucially, this narrative transcends agency – and simply involves intermittently attending to and attenuating sensory input. Attending to sensations enables the shared narrative to predict the sensations generated by another (i.e. to listen), while attenuating sensory input enables one to articulate the narrative (i.e. to speak). This produces a reciprocal exchange of sensory signals that, formally, induces a generalised synchrony between internal (neuronal) brain states generating predictions in both agents. We develop the arguments behind this perspective, using an active (Bayesian) inference framework and offer some simulations (of birdsong) as proof of principle.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Karl J.

This is somewhat paradoxical because backward modulatory characteristics would not be expected of driving motor command signals. We resolve this apparent paradox using a functional characterisation of the motor system based on Helmholtz’s ideas about perception; namely, that perception is inference on the causes of visual sensations. We explain behaviour in terms of inference on the causes of proprioceptive sensations. This explanation appeals to active inference, in which higher cortical levels send descending proprioceptive predictions, rather than motor commands. This process mirrors perceptual inference in sensory cortex, where descending connections convey predictions, while ascending connections convey prediction errors. The anatomical substrate of this recurrent message passing is a hierarchical system consisting of functionally asymmetric driving (ascending) and modulatory (descending) connections: an arrangement that we show is almost exactly recapitulated in the motor system, in terms of its laminar, topographic and physiological characteristics. This perspective casts classical motor reflexes as minimising prediction errors and may provide a principled explanation for why motor cortex is agranular.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Rick A.

The present proposal attempts to further characterize the bodily basis of the mind by adopting a naturalistic view of the phenomenological concept of intentionality as the a priori invariant character of any lived experience. Building on the Kantian definition of transcendentality as “what concerns the a priori formal structures of the subject’s mind” and as a precondition for the very possibility of human knowledge, we will suggest that this transcendental core may in fact be rooted in biology and can be examined within an extension of the theory of autopoiesis. The argument will be first clarified by examining its application to previously proposed elementary autopoietic models, to the bacterium, and to the immune system; it will be then further substantiated and illustrated by examining the mirror-neuron system and the default mode network as biological instances exemplifying the enactive nature of knowledge, and by discussing the phenomenological aspects of selected neurological conditions (neglect, schizophrenia). In this context, the free-energy principle proposed recently by Karl Friston will be briefly introduced as a rigorous, neurally-plausible framework that seems to accomodate optimally these ideas. While our approach is biologically-inspired, we will maintain that lived first-person experience is still critical for a better understanding of brain function, based on our argument that the former and the latter share the same transcendental structure. Finally, the role that disciplined contemplative practices can play to this aim, and an interpretation of the cognitive processes taking place during meditation under this perspective, will be also discussed.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Omar Timothy Khachouf","author_id":2570887760,"num_publications":2,"num_citations":36,"affiliation_name":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Stefano Poletti","author_id":2570609131,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":21,"affiliation_name":"University of Bologna","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Giuseppe Pagnoni","author_id":1974006674,"num_publications":78,"num_citations":8292,"affiliation_name":"University of Modena and Reggio Emilia","sequence_number":3}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2036228275,"node_type":"seed","size":1550,"connected_edge_ids":["2036228275-1977284696","3173661405-2036228275"],"connected_node_ids":[1977284696,3173661405],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2040834369,"pmid":"25018724","pmcid":"4071291","doi":"10.3389/fnhum.2014.00457"},"title":"Model averaging, optimal inference, and habit formation.","year":2014,"published_date":"2014-06-26","journal":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","abstract":"Postulating that the brain performs approximate Bayesian inference generates principled and empirically testable models of neuronal function – the subject of much current interest in neuroscience and related disciplines. Current formulations address inference and learning under some assumed and particular model. In reality, organisms are often faced with an additional challenge – that of determining which model or models of their environment are the best for guiding behaviour. Bayesian model averaging – which says that an agent should weight the predictions of different models according to their evidence – provides a principled way to solve this problem. Importantly, because model evidence is determined by both the accuracy and complexity of the model, optimal inference requires that these be traded off against one another. This means an agent’s behaviour should show an equivalent balance. We hypothesise that Bayesian model averaging plays an important role in cognition, given that it is both optimal and realisable within a plausible neuronal architecture. We outline model averaging and how it might be implemented, and then explore a number of implications for brain and behaviour. In particular, we propose that model averaging can explain a number of apparently suboptimal phenomena within the framework of approximate (bounded) Bayesian inference, focussing particularly upon the relationship between goal-directed and habitual behaviour.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Thomas H.

In this work, we explore the idea that saccadic eye movements are optimal experiments, in which data are gathered to test hypotheses or beliefs about how those data are caused. This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of self-organised behaviour: namely, the imperative to minimise the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently. This efficient sampling of salient information can be derived in a fairly straightforward way, using approximate Bayesian inference and variational free energy minimisation.

In this article, we review the evidence that autism could result from a dysfunctional oxytocin system early in life. As a mediator of successful procreation, not only in the reproductive system, but also in the brain, oxytocin plays a crucial role in sculpting socio-sexual behavior. Formulated within a (Bayesian) predictive coding framework, we propose that oxytocin encodes the saliency or precision of interoceptive signals and enables the neuronal plasticity necessary for acquiring a generative model of the emotional and social ‘self.’ An aberrant oxytocin system in infancy could therefore help explain the marked deficits in language and social communication – as well as the sensory, autonomic, motor, behavioral, and cognitive abnormalities – seen in autism.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"E.

Subjects’ eye tracking responses to a partially occluded sinusoidal target were recorded non-invasively and averaged. These response averages were then analysed using dynamic causal modelling (DCM). In DCM, observed responses are modelled using biologically plausible generative or forward models – usually biophysical models of neuronal activity.    New method  Our key innovation is to use a generative model based on a normative (Bayes-optimal) model of active inference to model oculomotor pursuit in terms of subjects’ beliefs about how visual targets move and how their oculomotor system responds. Our aim here is to establish the face validity of the approach, by manipulating the content and precision of sensory information – and examining the ensuing changes in the subjects’ implicit beliefs. These beliefs are inferred from their eye movements using the normative model.    Results  We show that on average, subjects respond to an increase in the ‘noise’ of target motion by increasing sensory precision in their models of the target trajectory. In other words, they attend more to the sensory attributes of a noisier stimulus. Conversely, subjects only change kinetic parameters in their model but not precision, in response to increased target speed.    Conclusions  Using this technique one can estimate the precisions of subjects’ hierarchical Bayesian beliefs about target motion. We hope to apply this paradigm to subjects with schizophrenia, whose pursuit abnormalities may result from the abnormal encoding of precision.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Rick A.

This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle – the minimisation of variational free energy – to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements – prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Rick A.

In brief, we associate a sense of agency with prior beliefs about action and ask what sorts of beliefs underlie optimal behaviour. In particular, we consider prior beliefs that action minimises the Kullback-Leibler divergence between desired states and attainable states in the future. This allows one to formulate bounded rationality as approximate Bayesian inference that optimises a free energy bound on model evidence. We show that constructs like expected utility, exploration bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of this formulation. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding and Bayesian filtering schemes for minimising free energy. Here, we consider variational Bayes as an alternative scheme that provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action – constraints that are remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Furthermore, this scheme contextualises optimal decision theory and economic (utilitarian) formulations as pure inference problems. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimisation, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (of softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution – that minimises free energy. This sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behaviour, such that attainable goals are afforded a higher precision or confidence. In turn, this means that optimal behaviour entails a representation of confidence about outcomes that are under an agent's control.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Karl J.

This framework should be able to integrate insights from several relevant disciplines: theory on embodied cognition, ecological psychology, phenomenology, dynamical systems theory, and neurodynamics. We suggest that the main task of Radical Embodied Cognitive Neuroscience is to investigate the phenomenon of skilled intentionality from the perspective of the self-organization of the brain-body-environment system, while doing justice to the phenomenology of skilled action. In previous work, we have characterized skilled intentionality as the organism’s tendency towards an optimal grip on multiple relevant affordances simultaneously. Affordances are possibilities for action provided by the environment. In the first part of this paper, we introduce the notion of skilled intentionality and the phenomenon of responsiveness to a field of relevant affordances. Second, we use Friston’s work on neurodynamics, but embed a very minimal version of his Free Energy Principle in the ecological niche of the animal. Thus amended, this principle is helpful for understanding the embeddedness of neurodynamics within the dynamics of the brain-body-environment system. Next, we show how we can use this adjusted principle to understand the neurodynamics of selective openness to the environment: interacting action-readiness patterns at multiple timescales contribute to the organism’s selective openness to relevant affordances. In the final part of the paper, we emphasize the important role of metastable dynamics in both the brain and the brain-body-environment system for adequate affordance-responsiveness. We exemplify our integrative approach by presenting research on the impact of Deep Brain Stimulation on affordance responsiveness of OCD patients.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Jelle Bruineberg","author_id":2656516332,"num_publications":22,"num_citations":601,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Erik Rietveld","author_id":2133004025,"num_publications":66,"num_citations":2086,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2115460576,"node_type":"seed","size":1800,"connected_edge_ids":["2802036381-2115460576","2534098824-2115460576","3049709870-2115460576","3126507886-2115460576","2115460576-2137411342","2115460576-1979732124","2115460576-2093466600","2115460576-2055789905","2558206955-2115460576","2933899145-2115460576","2970708184-2115460576","2564601941-2115460576","2783657280-2115460576","2884852581-2115460576","3194862499-2115460576","3096810469-2115460576","2484983710-2115460576","3131788766-2115460576","2953421850-2115460576","2793764002-2115460576","2754844655-2115460576","3196481983-2115460576","2909444209-2115460576","3173661405-2115460576","3019918398-2115460576","2914342221-2115460576","3213807182-2115460576","2797051230-2115460576"],"connected_node_ids":[2802036381,2534098824,3049709870,3126507886,2137411342,1979732124,2093466600,2055789905,2558206955,2933899145,2970708184,2564601941,2783657280,2884852581,3194862499,3096810469,2484983710,3131788766,2953421850,2793764002,2754844655,3196481983,2909444209,3173661405,3019918398,2914342221,3213807182,2797051230],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2122458046,"pmid":"25788538","pmcid":"4387527","doi":"10.1098/rsif.2014.1383"},"title":"Knowing one's place: a free-energy approach to pattern regulation","year":2015,"published_date":"2015-04-06","journal":"Journal of the Royal Society Interface","abstract":"Understanding how organisms establish their form during embryogenesis and regeneration represents a major knowledge gap in biological pattern formation. It has been recently suggested that morphogenesis could be understood in terms of cellular information processing and the ability of cell groups to model shape. Here, we offer a proof of principle that self-assembly is an emergent property of cells that share a common (genetic and epigenetic) model of organismal form. This behaviour is formulated in terms of variational free-energy minimization—of the sort that has been used to explain action and perception in neuroscience. In brief, casting the minimization of thermodynamic free energy in terms of variational free energy allows one to interpret (the dynamics of) a system as inferring the causes of its inputs—and acting to resolve uncertainty about those causes. This novel perspective on the coordination of migration and differentiation of cells suggests an interpretation of genetic codes as parametrizing a generative model—predicting the signals sensed by cells in the target morphology—and epigenetic processes as the subsequent inversion of that model. This theoretical formulation may complement bottom-up strategies—that currently focus on molecular pathways—with (constructivist) top-down approaches that have proved themselves in neuroscience and cybernetics.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Karl J.

The second experiment, in the auditory domain, involved free response detection of (non-semantic) near-threshold acoustic stimuli.

Hits (detection of near-threshold stimuli) were preceded by significantly higher activity than both misses of identical stimuli or false alarms, in which percepts arise in the absence of appropriate sensory input.

Recently, we proposed a generic model based on active (Bayesian) inference wherein dopamine encodes the precision of beliefs about optimal policies. Put simply, dopamine discharges reflect the confidence that a chosen policy will lead to desired outcomes. We designed a novel task to test this hypothesis, where subjects played a “limited offer” game in a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. Subjects had to decide how long to wait for a high offer before accepting a low offer, with the risk of losing everything if they waited too long. Bayesian model comparison showed that behavior strongly supported active inference, based on surprise minimization, over classical utility maximization schemes. Furthermore, midbrain activity, encompassing dopamine projection neurons, was accurately predicted by trial-by-trial variations in model-based estimates of precision. Our findings demonstrate that human subjects infer both optimal policies and the precision of those inferences, and thus support the notion that humans perform hierarchical probabilistic Bayesian inference. In other words, subjects have to infer both what they should do as well as how confident they are in their choices, where confidence may be encoded by dopaminergic firing.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Schwartenbeck","author_id":1840493039,"num_publications":36,"num_citations":1936,"affiliation_name":"Max Planck Society","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas H.

We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Karl J.

It is based on the notion that the brain is an inference machine that actively constructs hypotheses to explain or predict its sensations. This perspective provides a normative (Bayes optimal) account of action and perception that emphasises probabilistic representations; in particular, the confidence or precision of beliefs about the world. We will consider hallucinosis, abnormal eye movements, sensory attenuation deficits, catatonia and delusions as various expressions of the same core pathology: namely, an aberrant encoding of precision. From a cognitive perspective, this represents a pernicious failure of metacognition (beliefs about beliefs) that can confound perceptual inference. In the embodied setting of active (Bayesian) inference, it can lead to behaviours that are paradoxically more accurate than Bayes optimal behaviour. Crucially, this normative account is accompanied by a neuronally plausible process theory based upon hierarchical predictive coding. In predictive coding, precision is thought to be encoded by the postsynaptic gain of neurons reporting prediction error. This suggests that both pervasive trait abnormalities and florid failures of inference in the psychotic state can be linked to factors controlling postsynaptic gain – such as NMDA receptor function and (dopaminergic) neuromodulation. We illustrate these points using biologically plausible simulations of perceptual synthesis, smooth pursuit eye movements and attribution of agency – that all use the same predictive coding scheme and pathology: namely, a reduction in the precision of prior beliefs, relative to sensory evidence.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Rick A.

In some sense, your answer will cast the exercise as valuable—but what is value? In what follows, we suggest that value is evidence or, more exactly, log Bayesian evidence. This implies that a sufficient explanation for valuable behavior is the accumulation of evidence for internal models of our world. This contrasts with normative models of optimal control and reinforcement learning, which assume the existence of a value function that explains behavior, where (somewhat tautologically) behavior maximizes value. In this paper, we consider an alternative formulation—active inference—that replaces policies in normative models with prior beliefs about the (future) states agents should occupy. This enables optimal behavior to be cast purely in terms of inference: where agents sample their sensorium to maximize the evidence for their generative model of hidden states in the world, and minimize their uncertainty about those states. Crucially, this formulation resolves the tautology inherent in normative models and allows one to consider how prior beliefs are themselves optimized in a hierarchical setting. We illustrate these points by showing that any optimal policy can be specified with prior beliefs in the context of Bayesian inference. We then show how these prior beliefs are themselves prescribed by an imperative to minimize uncertainty.

Theoretical accounts of the minimal self have long recognized the importance and the ambivalence of the body as both part of the physical world, and the enabling condition for being in this world (Gallagher, 2005; Grafton, 2009). A recent account of minimal phenomenal selfhood (MPS, Metzinger, 2004a) centers on the consideration that minimal selfhood emerges as the result of basic self-modeling mechanisms, thereby being founded on pre-reflective bodily processes. The free energy principle (FEP, Friston, 2010) is a novel unified theory of cortical function that builds upon the imperative that self-organizing systems entail hierarchical generative models of the causes of their sensory input, which are optimized by minimizing free energy as an approximation of the log-likelihood of the model. The implementation of the FEP via predictive coding mechanisms and in particular the active inference principle emphasizes the role of embodiment for predictive self-modeling, which has been appreciated in recent publications. In this review, we provide an overview of these conceptions and illustrate thereby the potential power of the FEP in explaining the mechanisms underlying minimal selfhood and its key constituents, multisensory integration, interoception, agency, perspective, and the experience of mineness.

Alternatively, we can actively change sensory input to fulfil our predictions. In active inference, this action is mediated by classical reflex arcs that minimise proprioceptive prediction error created by descending proprioceptive predictions. However, this creates a conflict between action and perception; in that, self-generated movements require predictions to override the sensory evidence that one is not actually moving. However, ignoring sensory evidence means that externally generated sensations will not be perceived. Conversely, attending to (proprioceptive and somatosensory) sensations enables the detection of externally generated events but precludes generation of actions. This conflict can be resolved by attenuating the precision of sensory evidence during movement or, equivalently, attending away from the consequences of self-made acts. We propose that this Bayes optimal withdrawal of precise sensory evidence during movement is the cause of psychophysical sensory attenuation. Furthermore, it explains the force-matching illusion and reproduces empirical results almost exactly. Finally, if attenuation is removed, the force-matching illusion disappears and false (delusional) inferences about agency emerge. This is important, given the negative correlation between sensory attenuation and delusional beliefs in normal subjects—and the reduction in the magnitude of the illusion in schizophrenia. Active inference therefore links the neuromodulatory optimisation of precision to sensory attenuation and illusory phenomena during the attribution of agency in normal subjects. It also provides a functional account of deficits in syndromes characterised by false inference and impaired movement—like schizophrenia and Parkinsonism—syndromes that implicate abnormal modulatory neurotransmission.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Harriet R.

This normative model is equipped with a biologically plausible process theory in the form of predictive coding, where precision is encoded by the gain of superficial pyramidal cells reporting prediction error. We used dynamic causal modelling to assess the evidence in magnetoencephalographic responses for cue-dependent and top-down updating of superficial pyramidal cell gain.

The Editorial (this issue) asks: “what mechanisms, if any, mediate between perceptual and cognitive processes?” It has recently been argued that attention might furnish such a mechanism. In this paper, we pursue the idea that action planning (motor preparation) is an attentional phenomenon directed towards kinaesthetic signals. This rests on a view of motor control as active inference, where predictions of proprioceptive signals are fulfilled by peripheral motor reflexes. If valid, active inference suggests that attention should not be limited to the optimal biasing of perceptual signals in the exteroceptive (e.g. visual) domain but should also bias proprioceptive signals during movement. Here, we test this idea using a classical attention (Posner) paradigm cast in a motor setting. Specially, we looked for decreases in reaction times when movements were preceded by valid relative to invalid cues. Furthermore, we addressed the hierarchical level at which putative attentional effects were expressed by independently cueing the nature of the movement and the hand used to execute it. We found a significant interaction between the validity of movement and effector cues on reaction times. This suggests that attentional bias might be mediated at a low level in the motor hierarchy, in an intrinsic frame of reference. This finding is consistent with attentional enabling of top-down predictions of proprioceptive input and may rely upon the same synaptic mechanisms that mediate directed spatial attention in the visual system.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Harriet R.

We offer a resolution to this paradox based on an hypothesis that dopamine encodes the precision of beliefs about alternative actions, and thus controls the outcome-sensitivity of behavior. We extend an active inference scheme for solving Markov decision processes to include learning, and show that simulated dopamine dynamics strongly resemble those actually observed during instrumental conditioning. Furthermore, simulated dopamine depletion impairs performance but spares learning, while simulated excitation of dopamine neurons drives reward learning, through aberrant inference about outcome states.

We discovered that neurons in cultures of dissociated rat cortical cells could learn to represent particular sources while filtering out other signals. Specifically, the distinct classes of neurons in the culture learned to respond to the distinct sources after repeating training stimulation. Moreover, the neural network structures changed to reduce free energy, as predicted by the free-energy principle, a candidate unified theory of learning and memory, and by Jaynes’ principle of maximum entropy.

Subjects viewed a sinusoidal target, with or without random fluctuations in its motion. Eye trajectories and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data were recorded concurrently. The target was periodically occluded, such that its reappearance caused a visual evoked response field (ERF). Dynamic causal modelling (DCM) was used to fit models of eye trajectories and the ERFs. The DCM for pursuit was based on predictive coding and active inference, and predicts subjects' eye movements based on their (subjective) Bayesian beliefs about target (and eye) motion. The precisions of these hierarchical beliefs can be inferred from behavioural (pursuit) data. The DCM for MEG data used an established biophysical model of neuronal activity that includes parameters for the gain of superficial pyramidal cells, which is thought to encode precision at the neuronal level. Previous studies (using DCM of pursuit data) suggest that noisy target motion increases subjective precision at the sensory level: i.e., subjects attend more to the target's sensory attributes. We compared (noisy motion-induced) changes in the synaptic gain based on the modelling of MEG data to changes in subjective precision estimated using the pursuit data. We demonstrate that imprecise target motion increases the gain of superficial pyramidal cells in V1 (across subjects). Furthermore, increases in sensory precision – inferred by our behavioural DCM – correlate with the increase in gain in V1, across subjects. This is a step towards a fully integrated model of brain computations, cortical responses and behaviour that may provide a useful clinical tool in conditions like schizophrenia.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Rick A.

Such “intrinsic” brain activity, generated in the absence of an explicit task, is frequently associated with resting-state or default-mode networks. The focus on characterizing spontaneous brain activity promises to shed new light on questions concerning the structural and functional architecture of the brain and how they are related to “mind”. However, many critical questions have yet to be addressed. In this review, we focus on a scarcely explored area, specifically the energetic requirements and constraints of spontaneous activity, taking into account both thermodynamical and informational perspectives. We argue that the “classical” definitions of spontaneous activity do not take into account an important feature, that is, the critical thermodynamic energetic differences between spontaneous and evoked brain activity. Spontaneous brain activity is associated with slower oscillations compared with evoked, task-related activity, hence it exhibits lower levels of enthalpy and “free-energy” (i.e. the energy that can be converted to do work), thus supporting noteworthy thermodynamic energetic differences between spontaneous and evoked brain activity. Increased spike frequency during evoked activity has a significant metabolic cost, consequently, brain functions traditionally associated with spontaneous activity, such as mind wandering, require less energy that other nervous activities. We also review recent empirical observations in neuroscience, in order to capture how spontaneous brain dynamics and mental function can be embedded in a non-linear dynamical framework, which considers nervous activity in terms of phase spaces, particle trajectories, random walks, attractors and/or paths at the edge of the chaos. This takes us from the thermodynamic free-energy, to the realm of “variational free-energy”, a theoretical construct pertaining to probability and information theory which allows explanation of unexplored features of spontaneous brain activity.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Arturo Tozzi","author_id":2270132816,"num_publications":223,"num_citations":1326,"affiliation_name":"University of North Texas","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Marzieh Zare","author_id":2515578096,"num_publications":29,"num_citations":146,"affiliation_name":"Université de Montréal","sequence_number":2},{"name":"April A.

Active inference assumes that perception and action minimize variational free energy, where actions are selected to minimize the free energy expected in the future. This assumption generalizes risk-sensitive control and expected utility theory to include epistemic value; namely, the value (or salience) of information inherent in resolving uncertainty about the causes of ambiguous cues or outcomes. Here, we apply active inference to saccadic searches of a visual scene. We consider the (difficult) problem of categorizing a scene, based on the spatial relationship among visual objects where, crucially, visual cues are sampled myopically through a sequence of saccadic eye movements. This means that evidence for competing hypotheses about the scene has to be accumulated sequentially, calling upon both prediction (planning) and postdiction (memory). Our aim is to highlight some simple but fundamental aspects of the requisite functional anatomy; namely, the link between approximate Bayesian inference under mean field assumptions and functional segregation in the visual cortex. This link rests upon the (neurobiologically plausible) process theory that accompanies the normative formulation of active inference for Markov decision processes. In future work, we hope to use this scheme to model empirical saccadic searches and identify the prior beliefs that underwrite intersubject variability in the way people forage for information in visual scenes (e.g., in schizophrenia).","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"M.

It focuses on the distinction between goal-directed and habitual behaviour and how they contextualise each other. We show that habits emerge naturally (and autodidactically) from sequential policy optimisation when agents are equipped with state-action policies. In active inference, behaviour has explorative (epistemic) and exploitative (pragmatic) aspects that are sensitive to ambiguity and risk respectively, where epistemic (ambiguity-resolving) behaviour enables pragmatic (reward-seeking) behaviour and the subsequent emergence of habits. Although goal-directed and habitual policies are usually associated with model-based and model-free schemes, we find the more important distinction is between belief-free and belief-based schemes. The underlying (variational) belief updating provides a comprehensive (if metaphorical) process theory for several phenomena, including the transfer of dopamine responses, reversal learning, habit formation and devaluation. Finally, we show that active inference reduces to a classical (Bellman) scheme, in the absence of ambiguity.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Karl J.

If successful, this approach promises key insights into (pathological) brain function as well as a more mechanistic and quantitative approach to psychiatric nosology—structuring therapeutic interventions and predicting response and relapse. The basic procedure in computational psychiatry is to build a computational model that formalizes a behavioral or neuronal process. Measured behavioral (or neuronal) responses are then used to infer the model parameters of a single subject or a group of subjects. Here, we provide an illustrative overview over this process, starting from the modeling of choice behavior in a specific task, simulating data, and then inverting that model to estimate group effects. Finally, we illustrate cross-validation to assess whether between-subject variables (e.g., diagnosis) can be recovered successfully. Our worked example uses a simple two-step maze task and a model of choice behavior based on (active) inference and Markov decision processes. The procedural steps and routines we illustrate are not restricted to a specific field of research or particular computational model but can, in principle, be applied in many domains of computational psychiatry.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Schwartenbeck","author_id":1840493039,"num_publications":36,"num_citations":1936,"affiliation_name":"Max Planck Society","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

We attempt to integrate several related approaches in the study of the embodied, cognitive, and affective substrates of sociality and culture and the sociocultural scaffolding of experience. The integrative framework we propose bridges cognitive and social sciences to provide (i) an expanded concept of ‘affordance’ that extends to sociocultural forms of life, and (ii) a multilevel account of the socioculturally scaffolded forms of affordance learning and the transmission of affordances in patterned sociocultural practices and regimes of shared attention. This framework provides an account of how cultural content and normative practices are built on a foundation of contentless basic mental processes that acquire content through immersive participation of the agent in social practices that regulate joint attention and shared intentionality.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Maxwell J.

Here, we discuss a proof-of-principle implementation of the active inference scheme for the control or the 7-DoF arm of a (simulated) PR2 robot. By manipulating visual and proprioceptive noise levels, we show under which conditions robot control under the active inference scheme is accurate. Besides accurate control, our analysis of the internal system dynamics (e.g. the dynamics of the hidden states that are inferred during the inference) sheds light on key aspects of the framework such as the quintessentially multimodal nature of control and the differential roles of proprioception and vision. In the discussion, we consider the potential importance of being able to implement active inference in robots. In particular, we briefly review the opportunities for modelling psychophysiological phenomena such as sensory attenuation and related failures of gain control, of the sort seen in Parkinson's disease. We also consider the fundamental difference between active inference and optimal control formulations, showing that in the former the heavy lifting shifts from solving a dynamical inverse problem to creating deep forward or generative models with dynamics, whose attracting sets prescribe desired behaviours.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Léo Pio-Lopez","author_id":2424320066,"num_publications":10,"num_citations":94,"affiliation_name":"University of Auvergne","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Ange Nizard","author_id":2712211591,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":43,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":2},{"name":"Karl J.

The free-energy principle is a theoretical framework capturing the imperative for biological self-organization in information-theoretic terms. The free-energy principle has typically been connected with a Bayesian theory of predictive coding, and the latter is often taken to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception as unconscious inference. If our interpretation is right, however, a Helmholtzian view of perception is incompatible with Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle. We argue that the free energy principle and the ecological and enactive approach to mind and life make for a much happier marriage of ideas. We make our argument based on three points. First we argue that the free energy principle applies to the whole animal–environment system, and not only to the brain. Second, we show that active inference, as understood by the free-energy principle, is incompatible with unconscious inference understood as analagous to scientific hypothesis-testing, the main tenet of a Helmholtzian view of perception. Third, we argue that the notion of inference at work in Bayesian predictive coding under the free-energy principle is too weak to support a Helmholtzian theory of perception. Taken together these points imply that the free energy principle is best understood in ecological and enactive terms set out in this paper.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Jelle Bruineberg","author_id":2656516332,"num_publications":22,"num_citations":601,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Julian Kiverstein","author_id":787502387,"num_publications":72,"num_citations":1554,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Erik Rietveld","author_id":2133004025,"num_publications":66,"num_citations":2086,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":3}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2534098824,"node_type":"seed","size":1800,"connected_edge_ids":["2534098824-2024149692","2534098824-1979732124","2534098824-2484983710","2534098824-2115460576","2534098824-2080654992","2534098824-2122458046","2534098824-2055789905","2976973594-2534098824","3012959192-2534098824","3017990858-2534098824","3049709870-2534098824","3126507886-2534098824","2558206955-2534098824","2996530576-2534098824","2970708184-2534098824","2783657280-2534098824","2884852581-2534098824","3194862499-2534098824","3211802703-2534098824","2953421850-2534098824","3107960514-2534098824","2901597764-2534098824","2793764002-2534098824","2682853549-2534098824","2754844655-2534098824","2909444209-2534098824","2975220955-2534098824","2914342221-2534098824","2800982817-2534098824","2792679026-2534098824","2973013188-2534098824","3086777466-2534098824"],"connected_node_ids":[2024149692,1979732124,2484983710,2115460576,2080654992,2122458046,2055789905,2976973594,3012959192,3017990858,3049709870,3126507886,2558206955,2996530576,2970708184,2783657280,2884852581,3194862499,3211802703,2953421850,3107960514,2901597764,2793764002,2682853549,2754844655,2909444209,2975220955,2914342221,2800982817,2792679026,2973013188,3086777466],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2537237778,"pmid":"27826271","pmcid":"5078757","doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01638"},"title":"Why Harmless Sensations Might Hurt in Individuals with Chronic Pain: About Heightened Prediction and Perception of Pain in the Mind.","year":2016,"published_date":"2016-10-25","journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","abstract":"In individuals with chronic pain harmless bodily sensations can elicit anticipatory fear of pain resulting in maladaptive responses such as taking pain medication. Here, we aim to broaden the perspective taking into account recent evidence that suggests that interoceptive perception is largely a construction of beliefs, which are based on past experience and that are kept in check by the actual state of the body. Taking a Bayesian perspective, we propose that individuals with chronic pain display a heightened prediction of pain (prior probability p(pain)), which results in heightened pain perception (posterior probability p(pain|sensation)) due to an assumed link between pain and a harmless bodily sensation (p(sensation│pain)). This pain perception emerges because their mind infers pain as the most likely cause for the sensation. When confronted with a mismatch between predicted pain and a (harmless bodily) sensation, individuals with chronic pain try to minimize the mismatch most likely by active inference of pain or by an attentional shift. The active inference results in activities that produce a stronger sensation that will match with the prediction, allowing subsequent perceptual inference of pain. Here, we depict heightened pain perception in individuals with chronic pain by reformulating and extending the assumptions of the interoceptive predictive coding model from a Bayesian perspective. The review concludes with a research agenda and clinical considerations.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Tanja Hechler","author_id":2103170320,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2638,"affiliation_name":"Witten/Herdecke University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Dominik Endres","author_id":1984824453,"num_publications":85,"num_citations":1220,"affiliation_name":"University of Marburg","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Anna Thorwart","author_id":2345304031,"num_publications":30,"num_citations":326,"affiliation_name":"University of Marburg","sequence_number":3}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2537237778,"node_type":"seed","size":1600,"connected_edge_ids":["2537237778-2140487181","2537237778-2479616914","3210700158-2537237778","3196481983-2537237778"],"connected_node_ids":[2140487181,2479616914,3210700158,3196481983],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2551311960,"pmid":"27895566","pmcid":"5108808","doi":"10.3389/fnhum.2016.00550"},"title":"Allostatic Self-Efficacy: A Metacognitive Theory of Dyshomeostasis-Induced Fatigue and Depression","year":2016,"published_date":"2016-11-15","journal":"Frontiers in Human Neuroscience","abstract":"This paper outlines a hierarchical Bayesian framework for interoception, homeostatic/allostatic control, and meta-cognition that connects fatigue and depression to the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis. Specifically, viewing interoception as the inversion of a generative model of viscerosensory inputs allows for a formal definition of dyshomeostasis (as chronically enhanced surprise about bodily signals, or, equivalently, low evidence for the brain's model of bodily states) and allostasis (as a change in prior beliefs or predictions which define setpoints for homeostatic reflex arcs). Critically, we propose that the performance of interoceptive-allostatic circuitry is monitored by a metacognitive layer that updates beliefs about the brain's capacity to successfully regulate bodily states (allostatic self-efficacy). In this framework, fatigue and depression can be understood as sequential responses to the interoceptive experience of dyshomeostasis and the ensuing metacognitive diagnosis of low allostatic self-efficacy. While fatigue might represent an early response with adaptive value (cf. sickness behavior), the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis may trigger a generalized belief of low self-efficacy and lack of control (cf. learned helplessness), resulting in depression. This perspective implies alternative pathophysiological mechanisms that are reflected by differential abnormalities in the effective connectivity of circuits for interoception and allostasis. We discuss suitably extended models of effective connectivity that could distinguish these connectivity patterns in individual patients and may help inform differential diagnosis of fatigue and depression in the future.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Klaas E.

This surge of interest is accompanied by a proliferation of philosophical arguments, which seek to either extend or oppose various aspects of the emerging framework. In particular, the question of how to position predictive processing with respect to enactive and embodied cognition has become a topic of intense debate. While these arguments are certainly of valuable scientific and philosophical merit, they risk underestimating the variety of approaches gathered under the predictive label. Here, we first present a basic review of neuroscientific, cognitive, and philosophical approaches to PP, to illustrate how these range from solidly cognitivist applications—with a firm commitment to modular, internalistic mental representation—to more moderate views emphasizing the importance of ‘body-representations’, and finally to those which fit comfortably with radically enactive, embodied, and dynamic theories of mind. Any nascent predictive processing theory (e.g., of attention or consciousness) must take into account this continuum of views, and associated theoretical commitments. As a final point, we illustrate how the Free Energy Principle (FEP) attempts to dissolve tension between internalist and externalist accounts of cognition, by providing a formal synthetic account of how internal ‘representations’ arise from autopoietic self-organization. The FEP thus furnishes empirically productive process theories (e.g., predictive processing) by which to guide discovery through the formal modelling of the embodied mind.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Micah Allen","author_id":2336646708,"num_publications":61,"num_citations":2254,"affiliation_name":"Aarhus University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

We test the model using eye movement data from a human action observation study. In both the human study and our model, saccades are proactive whenever context affords accurate action prediction; but uncertainty induces a more reactive gaze strategy, via tracking the observed movements.

This mechanism ensures that attention is generally not drawn to sensory signals caused by own movement. Such attenuation has been observed across the animal kingdom and in different sensory modalities. In this study we used novel virtual reality (VR) devices to test the hypothesis that the human brain attenuates visual sensation in the area of the visual field where the subject's hand is currently moving. We conducted three VR experiments where we monitored hand position during movement while the participants performed a visual search task. In the first two experiments we measured response time for salient moving targets and observed that reaction time (RT) is slower for targets that are behind the (invisible) hand. This result provides the first evidence that the visual motion signals generated by the subject's own hand movement are suppressed. In the third experiment we observed that RT is also slower for colored targets behind the hand. Our findings provide support for the active inference account of sensory attenuation, which posits that attenuation occurs because attention is withdrawn from the sensory consequences of own movement. Furthermore, we demonstrate how modern VR tools could open up new exciting avenues of research for studying the interplay of action and perception.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Kristjan-Julius Laak","author_id":2584265591,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":4,"affiliation_name":"University of Tartu","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Madis Vasser","author_id":1988871359,"num_publications":14,"num_citations":45,"affiliation_name":"University of Tartu","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Oliver Jared Uibopuu","author_id":2584530903,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":4,"affiliation_name":"University of Tartu","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Jaan Aru","author_id":2945048150,"num_publications":70,"num_citations":1921,"affiliation_name":"University of Tartu","sequence_number":4}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2585482657,"node_type":"seed","size":1575,"connected_edge_ids":["2900691316-2585482657","2585482657-2900691316","2585482657-2151496011"],"connected_node_ids":[2900691316,2900691316,2151496011],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2593552556,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pone.0173684"},"title":"Iterative free-energy optimization for recurrent neural networks (INFERNO).","year":2017,"published_date":"2017-03-10","journal":"PLOS ONE","abstract":"The intra-parietal lobe coupled with the Basal Ganglia forms a working memory that demonstrates strong planning capabilities for generating robust yet flexible neuronal sequences. Neurocomputational models however, often fails to control long range neural synchrony in recurrent spiking networks due to spontaneous activity. As a novel framework based on the free-energy principle, we propose to see the problem of spikes’ synchrony as an optimization problem of the neurons sub-threshold activity for the generation of long neuronal chains. Using a stochastic gradient descent, a reinforcement signal (presumably dopaminergic) evaluates the quality of one input vector to move the recurrent neural network to a desired activity; depending on the error made, this input vector is strengthened to hill-climb the gradient or elicited to search for another solution. This vector can be learned then by one associative memory as a model of the basal-ganglia to control the recurrent neural network. Experiments on habit learning and on sequence retrieving demonstrate the capabilities of the dual system to generate very long and precise spatio-temporal sequences, above two hundred iterations. Its features are applied then to the sequential planning of arm movements. In line with neurobiological theories, we discuss its relevance for modeling the cortico-basal working memory to initiate flexible goal-directed neuronal chains of causation and its relation to novel architectures such as Deep Networks, Neural Turing Machines and the Free-Energy Principle.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Alexandre Pitti","author_id":2792273606,"num_publications":57,"num_citations":271,"affiliation_name":"Centre national de la recherche scientifique","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Philippe Gaussier","author_id":33044889,"num_publications":253,"num_citations":2297,"affiliation_name":"University of Paris-Seine","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Mathias Quoy","author_id":59558855,"num_publications":102,"num_citations":1021,"affiliation_name":"Centre national de la recherche scientifique","sequence_number":3}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2593552556,"node_type":"seed","size":1525,"connected_edge_ids":["2593552556-2059156134"],"connected_node_ids":[2059156134],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2606488938,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.04.009"},"title":"Deep temporal models and active inference","year":2017,"published_date":"2017-06-01","journal":"Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews","abstract":"How do we navigate a deeply structured world? Why are you reading this sentence first – and did you actually look at the fifth word? This review offers some answers by appealing to active inference based on deep temporal models. It builds on previous formulations of active inference to simulate behavioural and electrophysiological responses under hierarchical generative models of state transitions. Inverting these models corresponds to sequential inference, such that the state at any hierarchical level entails a sequence of transitions in the level below. The deep temporal aspect of these models means that evidence is accumulated over nested time scales, enabling inferences about narratives (i.e., temporal scenes). We illustrate this behaviour with Bayesian belief updating – and neuronal process theories – to simulate the epistemic foraging seen in reading. These simulations reproduce perisaccadic delay period activity and local field potentials seen empirically. Finally, we exploit the deep structure of these models to simulate responses to local (e.g., font type) and global (e.g., semantic) violations; reproducing mismatch negativity and P300 responses respectively.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Karl J.

Biological self-organization amounts to the minimization of surprise over time. We posit that any self-organizing system must embody a generative model whose predictions ensure that (expected) free energy is minimized through action. Plants respond in a fast, and yet coordinated manner, to environmental contingencies. They pro-actively sample their local environment to elicit information with an adaptive value. Our main thesis is that plant behaviour takes place by way of a process (active inference) that predicts the environmental sources of sensory stimulation. This principle, we argue, endows plants with a form of perception that underwrites purposeful, anticipatory behaviour. The aim of the article is to assess the prospects of a radical predictive processing story that would follow naturally from the free-energy principle for biological systems; an approach that may ultimately bear upon our understanding of life and cognition more broadly.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Paco Calvo","author_id":2142306642,"num_publications":60,"num_citations":730,"affiliation_name":"Intel","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

More recently, however, it has been extended beyond the brain to explain the dynamics of living systems, and their unique capacity to avoid decay. The aim of this review is to synthesise these advances with a meta-theoretical ontology of biological systems called variational neuroethology, which integrates the FEP with Tinbergen's four research questions to explain biological systems across spatial and temporal scales. We exemplify this framework by applying it to Homo sapiens, before translating variational neuroethology into a systematic research heuristic that supplies the biological, cognitive, and social sciences with a computationally tractable guide to discovery.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Maxwell J.

Within this perspective, the FEP occupies a particular level of the hierarchical organization of the organism, which is the level of biological self-organization. This form of biological self-organization is in turn understood as foundational and pervasive to the higher levels of organization of the human organism that are of interest to both neuroscience as well as psychoanalysis. Consequently, central psychoanalytic claims should be restated, in order to be located in their proper place within a hierarchical recursive organization of the (situated) organism. In light of the FEP the realisation of the psychoanalytic mind by the brain should be seen in terms of the evolution of different levels of systematic organisation where the concepts of psychoanalysis describe a level of hierarchical recursive organisation superordinate to that of biological self-organization and the FEP. The implication of this formulation is that while ‘psychoanalytic’ mental processes are fundamentally subject to the FEP, they nonetheless also add their own principles of process over and above that of the FEP. A model found in Grobbelaar (1989) offers a recursive bottom-up description of the self-organization of the psychoanalytic ego as dependent on the organization of language (and affect), which is itself founded upon the tendency towards autopoiesis (self-making) within the organism, which is in turn described as formally similar to the FEP. Meaningful consilience between Grobbelaar’s model and the hierarchical recursive description available in Friston’s (2010a) theory is described. The paper concludes that the valuable contribution of the FEP to psychoanalysis underscores the necessity of reengagement with the core concepts of psychoanalytic theory, and the usefulness that a systems theory epistemology - particularly hierarchical recursive description - can have for this goal.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Patrick Connolly","author_id":2760784985,"num_publications":6,"num_citations":24,"affiliation_name":"Hong Kong Shue Yan University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Vasi van Deventer","author_id":2429828350,"num_publications":16,"num_citations":108,"affiliation_name":"University of South Africa","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2757038055,"node_type":"seed","size":1650,"connected_edge_ids":["2986921757-2757038055","2757038055-2464934902","2757038055-2002907081","2757038055-2122458046","2757038055-2055789905","2809773754-2757038055"],"connected_node_ids":[2986921757,2464934902,2002907081,2122458046,2055789905,2809773754],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2765383588,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.1038/s41598-017-15249-0"},"title":"Working memory, attention, and salience in active inference","year":2017,"published_date":"2017-11-07","journal":"Scientific Reports","abstract":"The psychological concepts of working memory and attention are widely used in the cognitive and neuroscientific literatures. Perhaps because of the interdisciplinary appeal of these concepts, the same terms are often used to mean very different things. Drawing on recent advances in theoretical neurobiology, this paper tries to highlight the correspondence between these established psychological constructs and the formal processes implicit in mathematical descriptions of brain function. Here, we consider attention and salience from the perspective offered by active inference. Using variational principles and simulations, we use active inference to demonstrate how attention and salience can be disambiguated in terms of message passing between populations of neurons in cortical and subcortical structures. In brief, we suggest that salience is something that is afforded to actions that realise epistemic affordance, while attention per se is afforded to precise sensory evidence – or beliefs about the causes of sensations.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2605433224,"num_publications":37,"num_citations":1368,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

We use simulations of a maze problem to illustrate how agents can solve quite complicated problems using context sensitive prior preferences to form subgoals. Our focus is on how epistemic behaviour—driven by novelty and the imperative to reduce uncertainty about the world—contextualises pragmatic or goal-directed behaviour. Using simulations, we illustrate the underlying process theory with synthetic behavioural and electrophysiological responses during exploration of a maze and subsequent navigation to a target location.

This scheme provides a principled account of how people decide where to look, when categorising a visual scene based on its contents. In this paper, we use active inference to explain the visual searches of normal human subjects; enabling us to answer some key questions about visual foraging and salience attribution. First, we asked whether there is any evidence for ‘epistemic foraging’; i.e. exploration that resolves uncertainty about a scene. In brief, we used Bayesian model comparison to compare Markov decision process (MDP) models of scan-paths that did–and did not–contain the epistemic, uncertainty-resolving imperatives for action selection. In the course of this model comparison, we discovered that it was necessary to include non-epistemic (heuristic) policies to explain observed behaviour (e.g., a reading-like strategy that involved scanning from left to right). Despite this use of heuristic policies, model comparison showed that there is substantial evidence for epistemic foraging in the visual exploration of even simple scenes. Second, we compared MDP models that did–and did not–allow for changes in prior expectations over successive blocks of the visual search paradigm. We found that implicit prior beliefs about the speed and accuracy of visual searches changed systematically with experience. Finally, we characterised intersubject variability in terms of subject-specific prior beliefs. Specifically, we used canonical correlation analysis to see if there were any mixtures of prior expectations that could predict between-subject differences in performance; thereby establishing a quantitative link between different behavioural phenotypes and Bayesian belief updating. We demonstrated that better scene categorisation performance is consistently associated with lower reliance on heuristics; i.e., a greater use of a generative model of the scene to direct its exploration.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"M.

This implies that SZ subjects should both initiate responses prematurely during evidence-accumulation tasks and fail to inhibit their responses at long stop-signal delays. SZ and healthy control subjects were asked to report the timing of billiards-ball collisions and were occasionally required to withhold their responses. SZ subjects showed larger temporal estimation errors, which were associated with premature responses and decreased response inhibition. To account for these effects, we used hierarchical (Bayesian) drift-diffusion models (HDDM) and model selection procedures to adjudicate among four hypotheses. HDDM revealed that the precision of prior beliefs (i.e., starting point) rather than increased sensory precision (i.e., drift rate) drove premature responses and impaired response inhibition in patients with SZ. From the perspective of active inference, we suggest that premature predictions in SZ are responses that, heuristically, are traded off against accuracy to ensure action execution. On the basis of previous work, we suggest that the right insular cortex might mediate this trade-off.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Roberto Limongi","author_id":2358321808,"num_publications":36,"num_citations":281,"affiliation_name":"University of Western Ontario","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Bartosz Bohaterewicz","author_id":2783610672,"num_publications":16,"num_citations":51,"affiliation_name":"Jagiellonian University","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Magdalena Nowicka","author_id":2609813913,"num_publications":5,"num_citations":19,"affiliation_name":"University of Social Sciences and Humanities","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Aleksandra Plewka","author_id":2783114139,"num_publications":2,"num_citations":15,"affiliation_name":"University of Social Sciences and Humanities","sequence_number":4},{"name":"Karl J.

It does so by considering the boundaries of biological systems, from individual cells to  Home sapiens , in terms of the presence of Markov blankets under the active inference scheme—a corollary of the free energy principle. A Markov blanket defines the boundaries of a system in a statistical sense. Here we consider how a collective of Markov blankets can self-assemble into a global system that itself has a Markov blanket; thereby providing an illustration of how autonomous systems can be understood as having layers of nested and self-sustaining boundaries. This allows us to show that: (i) any living system is a Markov blanketed system and (ii) the boundaries of such systems need not be co-extensive with the biophysical boundaries of a living organism. In other words, autonomous systems are hierarchically composed of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—all the way down to individual cells, all the way up to you and me, and all the way out to include elements of the local environment.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Michael D.

The study of motivated control traditionally assumes a distinction between control and motivational processes, which map to distinct (dorsolateral versus ventromedial) brain systems. However, the respective roles and interactions between these processes remain controversial. We offer a novel perspective that casts control and motivational processes as complementary aspects − goal propagation and prioritization, respectively − of active inference and hierarchical goal processing under deep generative models. We propose that the control hierarchy propagates prior preferences or goals, but their precision is informed by the motivational context, inferred at different levels of the motivational hierarchy. The ensuing integration of control and motivational processes underwrites action and policy selection and, ultimately, motivated behaviour, by enabling deep inference to prioritize goals in a context-sensitive way.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Giovanni Pezzulo","author_id":2038907673,"num_publications":238,"num_citations":7635,"affiliation_name":"National Research Council","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Francesco Rigoli","author_id":1893076578,"num_publications":57,"num_citations":2209,"affiliation_name":"City University London","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Karl J.

This review considers a new approach based on existing theories of functional brain organisation. The free energy principle (a.k.a. active inference), and its instantiation in the Bayesian brain, offers a complete and simple formulation of mood. It has been proposed that emotions reflect the precision of – or certainty about – the predicted sensorimotor/interoceptive consequences of action. By extending this reasoning, in a hierarchical setting, we suggest mood states act as (hyper) priors over uncertainty (i.e. emotions). Here, we consider the same computational pathology in the proprioceptive and interoceptive (behavioural and autonomic) domain in order to furnish an explanation for mood disorders.

They have facilitated the growth of formal approaches to disease, particularly in psychiatric research. In this paper, we provide a narrative review of the body of computational research addressing neuropsychological syndromes, and focus on those that employ Bayesian frameworks. Bayesian approaches to understanding brain function formulate perception and action as inferential processes. These inferences combine ‘prior’ beliefs with a generative (predictive) model to explain the causes of sensations. Under this view, neuropsychological deficits can be thought of as false inferences that arise due to aberrant prior beliefs (that are poor fits to the real world). This draws upon the notion of a Bayes optimal pathology – optimal inference with suboptimal priors – and provides a means for computational phenotyping. In principle, any given neuropsychological disorder could be characterised by the set of prior beliefs that would make a patient’s behaviour appear Bayes optimal. We start with an overview of some key theoretical constructs and use these to motivate a form of computational neuropsychology that relates anatomical structures in the brain to the computations they perform. Throughout, we draw upon computational accounts of neuropsychological syndromes. These are selected to emphasise the key features of a Bayesian approach, and the possible types of pathological prior that may be present.

Starting from a generative model based on simple Newtonian equations of motion, we derive a variational solution to this problem and illustrate the plausibility of its implementation in the oculomotor brainstem. We show, through simulation, that the Bayesian filtering equations that implement ‘planning as inference’ can generate both saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements. Crucially, the associated message passing maps well onto the known connectivity and neuroanatomy of the brainstem – and the changes in these messages over time are strikingly similar to single unit recordings of neurons in the corresponding nuclei. Furthermore, we show that simulated lesions to axonal pathways reproduce eye movement patterns of neurological patients with damage to these tracts.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2605433224,"num_publications":37,"num_citations":1368,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

AIF opposes the mechanistic to the reductive, while staying fully grounded in a naturalistic and information theoretic foundation, using the principle of free energy minimization. The latter provides a theoretical basis for a unified treatment of particles, organisms, and interactive machines, spanning from the inorganic to organic, non-life to life, and natural to artificial agents.

We show how the organised forms of attachment (secure, avoidant and ambivalent) might arise in (Bayesian) infants. Specifically, we show that these distinct forms of attachment emerge from a minimisation of free energy—over interoceptive states relating to internal stress levels—when seeking proximity to caregivers who have a varying impact on these interoceptive states. In line with empirical findings in disrupted patterns of affective communication, we then demonstrate how exteroceptive cues (in the form of caregiver-mediated AMBIANCE affective communication errors, ACE) can result in disorganised forms of attachment in infants of caregivers who consistently increase stress when the infant seeks proximity, but can have an organising (towards ambivalence) effect in infants of inconsistent caregivers. In particular, we differentiate disorganised attachment from avoidance in terms of the high epistemic value of proximity seeking behaviours (resulting from the caregiver’s misleading exteroceptive cues) that preclude the emergence of coherent and organised behavioural policies. Our work, the first to formulate infant attachment in terms of active inference, makes a new testable prediction with regards to the types of affective communication errors that engender ambivalent attachment.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"David Cittern","author_id":305879114,"num_publications":7,"num_citations":26,"affiliation_name":"Imperial College London","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Tobias Nolte","author_id":2105478478,"num_publications":71,"num_citations":1003,"affiliation_name":"Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health NHS Trust","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Karl J.

There is ongoing debate, however, on the extent to which niche construction ought to be considered a bona fide evolutionary force, on a par with natural selection. Recent formulations of the variational free-energy principle as applied to the life sciences describe the properties of living systems, and their selection in evolution, in terms of variational inference. We argue that niche construction can be described using a variational approach. We propose new arguments to support the niche construction perspective, and to extend the variational approach to niche construction to current perspectives in various scientific fields.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Axel Constant","author_id":2794928491,"num_publications":28,"num_citations":499,"affiliation_name":"University of Sydney","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Maxwell J.

The pattern theory of self, however, has been criticized for failing to explicate the dynamical relations among elements of the self-pattern (e.g., Beni 2016; de Haan et al. 2017; Kyselo 2014); as such, it seems to be nothing more than a mere list of elements. We’ll argue that the dynamics of a self-pattern are reflected in three significant and interrelated ways that allow for investigation. First, a self-pattern is reflectively reiterated in its narrative component. Second, studies of psychiatric or neurological disorders can help us understand the precise nature of the dynamical relations in a self-pattern, and how they can fail. Third, referencing predictive processing accounts, neuroscience can also help to explicate the dynamical relations that constitute the self-pattern.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Shaun Gallagher","author_id":2144173364,"num_publications":404,"num_citations":14188,"affiliation_name":"University College Hospital","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Anya Daly","author_id":2099204297,"num_publications":28,"num_citations":64,"affiliation_name":"University of Melbourne","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2800982817,"node_type":"seed","size":1650,"connected_edge_ids":["2970708184-2800982817","3107960514-2800982817","2800982817-2534098824","2800982817-2148544865","2800982817-2151496011","2800982817-2558206955"],"connected_node_ids":[2970708184,3107960514,2534098824,2148544865,2151496011,2558206955],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2802947734,"pmid":"29780343","pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2018.00643"},"title":"'Seeing the Dark': Grounding Phenomenal Transparency and Opacity in Precision Estimation for Active Inference.","year":2018,"published_date":"2018-05-04","journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","abstract":"One of the central claims of the Self-model Theory of Subjectivity is that the experience of being someone – even in a minimal form – arises through a transparent phenomenal self-model, which itself can in principle be reduced to brain processes. Here, we consider whether it is possible to distinguish between phenomenally transparent and opaque states in terms of active inference. We propose a relationship of phenomenal opacity to expected uncertainty or precision; i.e., the capacity for introspective attention and implicit mental action. Thus we associate introspective attention with the deployment of ‘precision’ that may render the perceptual evidence (for action) opaque, while treating transparency as a necessary aspect of beliefs about action, i.e., ‘what I am’ doing. We conclude by proposing how we may have to nuance our conception of minimal phenomenal selfhood and agency in light of this active inference conception of transparency-opacity.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Jakub Limanowski","author_id":2040021002,"num_publications":27,"num_citations":676,"affiliation_name":"Dresden University of Technology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

One successful approach involves predictive coding and Bayesian inference. Here, inferences regarding the current state of the world are made by combining prior beliefs with incoming sensory signals. Mismatches between prior beliefs and incoming signals constitute prediction errors that drive new learning. Psychosis has been suggested to result from a decreased precision in the encoding of prior beliefs relative to the sensory data, thereby garnering maladaptive inferences. Here, we review the current evidence for aberrant predictive coding and discuss challenges for this canonical predictive coding account of psychosis. For example, hallucinations and delusions may relate to distinct alterations in predictive coding, despite their common co-occurrence. More broadly, some studies implicate weakened prior beliefs in psychosis, and others find stronger priors. These challenges might be answered with a more nuanced view of predictive coding. Different priors may be specified for different sensory modalities and their integration, and deficits in each modality need not be uniform. Furthermore, hierarchical organization may be critical. Altered processes at lower levels of a hierarchy need not be linearly related to processes at higher levels (and vice versa). Finally, canonical theories do not highlight active inference—the process through which the effects of our actions on our sensations are anticipated and minimized. It is possible that conflicting findings might be reconciled by considering these complexities, portending a framework for psychosis more equipped to deal with its many manifestations.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Philipp Sterzer","author_id":2971266672,"num_publications":31,"num_citations":1001,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1},{"name":"Philipp Sterzer","author_id":27550152,"num_publications":232,"num_citations":9426,"affiliation_name":"Humboldt University of Berlin","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Rick A.

More specifically, it can be regarded as a systematic attempt to understand the 'fit' between an embodied agent and its niche, where the quantity of free-energy is a measure for the 'misfit' or disattunement (Bruineberg and Rietveld, 2014) between agent and environment. This paper offers a proof-of-principle simulation of niche construction under the free-energy principle. Agent-centered treatments have so far failed to address situations where environments change alongside agents, often due to the action of agents themselves. The key point of this paper is that the minimum of free-energy is not at a point in which the agent is maximally adapted to the statistics of a static environment, but can better be conceptualized an attracting manifold within the joint agent-environment state-space as a whole, which the system tends toward through mutual interaction. We will provide a general introduction to active inference and the free-energy principle. Using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), we then describe a canonical generative model and the ensuing update equations that minimize free-energy. We then apply these equations to simulations of foraging in an environment; in which an agent learns the most efficient path to a pre-specified location. In some of those simulations, unbeknownst to the agent, the 'desire paths' emerge as a function of the activity of the agent (i.e. niche construction occurs). We will show how, depending on the relative inertia of the environment and agent, the joint agent-environment system moves to different attracting sets of jointly minimized free-energy.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Jelle Bruineberg","author_id":2656516332,"num_publications":22,"num_citations":601,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Erik Rietveld","author_id":2133004025,"num_publications":66,"num_citations":2086,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2605433224,"num_publications":37,"num_citations":1368,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":3},{"name":"Leendert van Maanen","author_id":1860579896,"num_publications":79,"num_citations":1449,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":4},{"name":"Karl J.

In this paper, we describe a Bayes optimal and biologically plausible scheme that refines these beliefs through a gradient descent on variational free energy. To illustrate this, we simulate belief updating during visual foraging and show that changes in estimated sensory precision (i.e. confidence in visual data) are highly sensitive to prior beliefs about the contents of a visual scene. In brief, confident prior beliefs induce an increase in estimated precision when consistent with sensory evidence, but a decrease when they conflict. Prior beliefs held with low confidence are rapidly updated to posterior beliefs, determined by sensory data. These induce much smaller changes in beliefs about sensory precision. We argue that pathologies of scene construction may be due to abnormal priors, and show that these can induce a reduction in estimated sensory precision. Having previously associated this precision with cholinergic signalling, we note that several neurodegenerative conditions are associated with visual disturbances and cholinergic deficits; notably, the synucleinopathies. On relating the message passing in our model to the functional anatomy of the ventral visual stream, we find that simulated neuronal loss in temporal lobe regions induces confident, inaccurate, empirical prior beliefs at lower levels in the visual hierarchy.

'Hidden state' exploration motivates agents to sample unambiguous observations to accurately infer the (hidden) state of the world. Conversely, 'model parameter' exploration, compels agents to sample outcomes associated with high uncertainty, if they are informative for their representation of the task structure. We illustrate the emergence of these types of information-gain, termed active inference and active learning, and show how these forms of exploration induce distinct patterns of 'Bayes-optimal' behaviour.

The phenomenology of REMs speaks to the notion that perceptual experience in both sleep and wakefulness is a constructive process – in which we generate predictions of sensory inputs and then test those predictions through actively sampling the sensorium with eye movements. On this view, REMs during sleep may index an internalized active sampling or ‘scanning’ of self-generated visual constructs that are not constrained by visual input. If this view is correct, it renders REMs an ideal probe to study consciousness as “an exclusively internal affair” (Metzinger 2009). In other words, REMs offer a probe of active inference – in the sense of predictive coding – when the brain is isolated from the sensorium in virtue of the natural blockade of sensory input during REM sleep. REMs are temporally precise events that enable powerful inferences based on timeseries analyses. As a natural, task-free probe, [REMs] could be used in non-compliant subjects, including infants and animals. In short, REM constitutes a promising probe to study the ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of consciousness and perhaps its abnormal development in schizophrenia and autism, which have been considered in terms of aberrant predictive coding.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Charles Chong-Hwa Hong","author_id":2779087232,"num_publications":7,"num_citations":171,"affiliation_name":"Johns Hopkins University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"James H.

It has been argued that the motor system is involved in perception and action, playing a fundamental role in the handling of actions produced by oneself and by others. But how does it distinguish in this processing between self and other, thus contributing to self-other distinction? In this paper we propose a hierarchical model of sensorimotor coordination based on principles of perception-action coupling and predictive processing in which self-other distinction arises during action and perception. For this we draw on mechanisms assumed for the integration of cues for a sense of agency, i.e., the sense that an action is self-generated. We report results from simulations of different scenarios, showing that the model is not only able to minimize free energy during perception and action, but also showing that the model can correctly attribute sense of agency to own actions.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Sebastian Kahl","author_id":2105100619,"num_publications":14,"num_citations":67,"affiliation_name":"Bielefeld University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Stefan Kopp","author_id":2048887081,"num_publications":332,"num_citations":5474,"affiliation_name":"Bielefeld University","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2897094888,"node_type":"seed","size":1600,"connected_edge_ids":["2897094888-2606488938","2897094888-2151496011","2897094888-2623066203","2897094888-2140487181"],"connected_node_ids":[2606488938,2151496011,2623066203,2140487181],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2898093302,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02053"},"title":"Context-Dependent Risk Aversion: A Model-Based Approach.","year":2018,"published_date":"2018-10-26","journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","abstract":"Most research on risk aversion in behavioral science with human subjects has focused on a component of risk aversion that does not adapt itself to context. More recently, studies have explored risk aversion adaptation to changing circumstances in sequential decision-making tasks. It is an open question whether one can identify evidence, at the single subject level, for such risk aversion adaptation. We conducted a behavioral experiment on human subjects, using a sequential decision making task. We developed a model-based approach for estimating the adaptation of risk-taking behavior with single-trial resolution by modelling a subject’s goals and internal representation of task contingencies. Using this model-based approach, we estimated the subject-specific adaptation of risk aversion depending on the current task context. We found striking inter-subject variations in the adaptation of risk-taking behavior. We show that these differences can be explained by differences in subjects’ internal representations of task contingencies and goals. We discuss that the proposed approach can be adapted to a wide range of experimental paradigms and be used to analyze behavioral measures other than risk aversion.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Darío Cuevas Rivera","author_id":2205451456,"num_publications":4,"num_citations":9,"affiliation_name":"Dresden University of Technology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Florian Ott","author_id":2898571613,"num_publications":6,"num_citations":9,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":2},{"name":"Florian Ott","author_id":3143812714,"num_publications":8,"num_citations":12,"affiliation_name":"Dresden University of Technology","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Florian Ott","author_id":2534444335,"num_publications":16,"num_citations":396,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":2},{"name":"Florian Ott","author_id":2116461150,"num_publications":41,"num_citations":480,"affiliation_name":"ETH Zurich","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Dimitrije Markovic","author_id":2509163039,"num_publications":46,"num_citations":734,"affiliation_name":"Dresden University of Technology","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Alexander Strobel","author_id":2111323858,"num_publications":134,"num_citations":4404,"affiliation_name":"Dresden University of Technology","sequence_number":4},{"name":"Stefan J.

Over two experiments, we measured the effects of such \"virtual occlusion\" on first-order sensitivity and on metacognitive monitoring.

This necessitates passing local messages between populations of neurons to update beliefs about hidden variables in the world beyond its sensory samples. It also entails inferences about how we will act. Active inference is a principled framework that frames perception and action as approximate Bayesian inference. This has been successful in accounting for a wide range of physiological and behavioural phenomena. Recently, a process theory has emerged that attempts to relate inferences to their neurobiological substrates. In this paper, we review and develop the anatomical aspects of this process theory. We argue that the form of the generative models required for inference constrains the way in which brain regions connect to one another. Specifically, neuronal populations representing beliefs about a variable must receive input from populations representing the Markov blanket of that variable. We illustrate this idea in four different domains: perception, planning, attention, and movement.

The PCM combines a projective geometrical model of the perspectival phenomenological structure of the field of consciousness with a variational Free Energy minimization model of active inference, yielding an account of the cybernetic function of consciousness, viz., the modulation of the field’s cognitive and affective dynamics for the effective control of embodied agents. The geometrical and active inference components are linked via the concept of projective transformation, which is crucial to understanding how conscious organisms integrate perception, emotion, memory, reasoning, and perspectival imagination in order to control behavior, enhance resilience, and optimize preference satisfaction. The PCM makes substantive empirical predictions and fits well into a (neuro)computationalist framework. It also helps us to account for aspects of subjective character that are sometimes ignored or conflated: pre-reflective self-consciousness, the first-person point of view, the sense of minenness or ownership, and social self-consciousness. We argue that the PCM, though still in development, offers us the most complete theory to date of what Thomas Metzinger has called “phenomenal selfhood”.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Kenneth Williford","author_id":2034735539,"num_publications":23,"num_citations":377,"affiliation_name":"University of Texas at Arlington","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Daniel Bennequin","author_id":2634354927,"num_publications":17,"num_citations":226,"affiliation_name":"University of Paris","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Karl J.

We review a framework for modelling complex adaptive control systems for multiscale free energy bounding organism–niche dynamics, thereby integrating the modelling strategies and heuristics of variational neuroethology with a broader perspective on the ecological nestedness of biotic systems. We extend the multiscale variational formulation beyond the action–perception loops of individual organisms by appealing to the variational approach to niche construction to explain the dynamics of coupled systems constituted by organisms and their ecological niche. We suggest that the statistical robustness of living systems is inherited, in part, from their eco-niches, as niches help coordinate dynamical patterns across larger spatiotemporal scales. We call this approach variational ecology. We argue that, when applied to cultural animals such as humans, variational ecology enables us to formulate not just a physics of individual minds, but also a physics of interacting minds across spatial and temporal scales – a physics of sentient systems that range from cells to societies.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Maxwell J.

We first survey key principles of new radical (extended, enactive, embodied) views of cognition. We then describe an internalist interpretation premised on the Markov blanket formalism. Having reviewed these accounts, we develop our positive multiscale account. We argue that the statistical seclusion of internal from external states of the system – entailed by the existence of a Markov boundary – can coexist happily with the multiscale integration of the system through its dynamics. Our approach does not privilege any given boundary (whether it be that of the brain, body, or world), nor does it argue that all boundaries are equally prescient. We argue that the relevant boundaries of cognition depend on the level being characterised and the explanatory interests that guide investigation. We approach the issue of how and where to draw the boundaries of cognitive systems through a multiscale ontology of cognitive systems, which offers a multidisciplinary research heuristic for cognitive science.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Maxwell J.

The neural correlates of this feeling remain controversial however, as experimental manipulation of the action-outcome chain often introduces mismatch or prediction errors that strongly correlate with the sense of agency. Here, we took a different approach and manipulated the causal belief (self-attribution vs. computer-attribution) by external cues during matched visuo-motor tapping conditions. With magneto-encephalography, we studied the sense of agency from a network perspective, investigating in source space the modulation of local population activity and changes in functional connectivity with motor cortex. Our results show that during the belief of agency primary motor cortex(M1) shows stronger functional connectivity (mediated by the beta band) to inferior parietal lobe and right middle temporal gyrus (MTG). Furthermore, the local feed-forward activity (gamma band power) in extrastriate body area and MTG disappears with that belief. After changes in action context, left M1 shows stronger connectivity in the alpha band with right premotor cortex and left insular-temporal cortex a network that might support active inference in social action context. Finally, a better tapping performance in this rhythmic task was related to alpha power modulations in the bilateral cerebellum and bilateral fusiform body-area, with power suppression during a more precise performance. These findings highlight the role of multiple networks supporting the sense of agency by changing their relative contribution for different causal beliefs.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Verena N.

In particular, the free energy principle and active inference are increasingly popular theories of cognitive functions that claim to offer a unified understanding of life and cognition within a general mathematical framework derived from information and control theory, and statistical mechanics. However, we argue that if the active inference proposal is to be taken as a general process theory for biological systems, it is necessary to understand how it relates to existing control theoretical approaches routinely used to study and explain biological systems. For example, recently, PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control has been shown to be implemented in simple molecular systems and is becoming a popular mechanistic explanation of behaviours such as chemotaxis in bacteria and amoebae, and robust adaptation in biochemical networks. In this work, we will show how PID controllers can fit a more general theory of life and cognition under the principle of (variational) free energy minimisation when using approximate linear generative models of the world. This more general interpretation also provides a new perspective on traditional problems of PID controllers such as parameter tuning as well as the need to balance performances and robustness conditions of a controller. Specifically, we then show how these problems can be understood in terms of the optimisation of the precisions (inverse variances) modulating different prediction errors in the free energy functional.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Manuel Baltieri","author_id":2549788773,"num_publications":34,"num_citations":286,"affiliation_name":"RIKEN Brain Science Institute","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Christopher L.

Characteristic features include tics, recurrent movements that are experienced as compulsive and ‘unwilled’; uncomfortable premonitory sensations that resolve through tic release; and often, the ability to suppress tics temporarily. We demonstrate how these symptoms and features can be understood in terms of aberrant predictive (Bayesian) processing in hierarchical neural systems, explaining specifically: why tics arise, their ‘unvoluntary’ nature, how premonitory sensations emerge, and why tic suppression works – sometimes. In our model, premonitory sensations and tics are generated through over-precise priors for sensation and action within somatomotor regions of the striatum. Abnormally high precision of priors arises through the dysfunctional synaptic integration of cortical inputs. These priors for sensation and action are projected into primary sensory and motor areas, triggering premonitory sensations and tics, which in turn elicit prediction errors for unexpected feelings and movements. We propose experimental paradigms to validate this Bayesian account of tics. Our model integrates behavioural, neuroimaging, and computational approaches to provide mechanistic insight into the pathophysiological basis of Tourette syndrome.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Charlotte L.

Active inference (AI) is a corollary of the FEP, which states that biological agents act to fulfill prior beliefs about preferred future observations (target priors). Purposeful behavior then results from variational free energy minimization with respect to a generative model of the environment with included target priors. However, manual derivations for free energy minimizing algorithms on custom dynamic models can become tedious and error-prone. While probabilistic programming (PP) techniques enable automatic derivation of inference algorithms on free-form models, full automation of AI requires specialized tools for inference on dynamic models, together with the description of an experimental protocol that governs the interaction between the agent and its simulated environment. The contributions of the present paper are two-fold. Firstly, we illustrate how AI can be automated with the use of ForneyLab, a recent PP toolbox that specializes in variational inference on flexibly definable dynamic models. More specifically, we describe AI agents in a dynamic environment as probabilistic state space models (SSM) and perform inference for perception and control in these agents by message passing on a factor graph representation of the SSM. Secondly, we propose a formal experimental protocol for simulated AI. We exemplify how this protocol leads to goal-directed behavior for flexibly definable AI agents in two classical RL examples, namely the Bayesian thermostat and the mountain car parking problems.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Thijs van de Laar","author_id":2580371699,"num_publications":13,"num_citations":91,"affiliation_name":"Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Bert de Vries","author_id":2662646260,"num_publications":41,"num_citations":258,"affiliation_name":"Eindhoven University of Technology","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Bert de Vries","author_id":3132771342,"num_publications":9,"num_citations":39,"affiliation_name":"Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Systems","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2929539807,"node_type":"seed","size":1800,"connected_edge_ids":["3154473905-2929539807","3204374301-2929539807","3217653593-2929539807","2929539807-2769704218","2929539807-2606488938","2929539807-2754844655","2929539807-2767022047","2929539807-2525228457","2929539807-2137411342","2929539807-2623066203","2929539807-2463330366","2929539807-2055789905","3098317736-2929539807","3022054609-2929539807","3123260937-2929539807"],"connected_node_ids":[3154473905,3204374301,3217653593,2769704218,2606488938,2754844655,2767022047,2525228457,2137411342,2623066203,2463330366,2055789905,3098317736,3022054609,3123260937],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2931034662,"pmid":"30984063","pmcid":"6447687","doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00592"},"title":"\"Surprise\" and the Bayesian Brain: Implications for Psychotherapy Theory and Practice.","year":2019,"published_date":"2019-03-28","journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","abstract":"The free energy principle (FEP) has gained widespread interest and growing acceptance\nas a new paradigm of brain function, but has had little impact on the theory and practice\nof psychotherapy.

This paper offers a normative framework to answer this question. We introduce the computational construct of ‘deontic value’ – based on active inference and Markov decision processes – to formalise conceptions of social conformity and human decision-making. Deontic value is an attribute of choices, behaviours, or action sequences that inherit directly from deontic cues in our econiche (e.g., red traffic lights); namely, cues that denote an obligatory social rule. Crucially, the prosocial aspect of deontic value rests upon a particular form of circular causality: deontic cues exist in the environment in virtue of the environment being modified by repeated actions, while action itself is contingent upon the deontic value of environmental cues. We argue that this construction of deontic cues enables the epistemic (i.e., information-seeking) and pragmatic (i.e., goal- seeking) values of any behaviour to be ‘cached’ or ‘outsourced’ to the environment, where the environment effectively ‘learns’ about the behaviour of its denizens. We describe the process whereby this particular aspect of value enables learning of habitual behaviour over neurodevelopmental and transgenerational timescales.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Axel Constant","author_id":3013138701,"num_publications":2,"num_citations":158,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1},{"name":"Axel Constant","author_id":2794928491,"num_publications":28,"num_citations":499,"affiliation_name":"University of Sydney","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Maxwell J.

Accordingly, we asked whether peripersonal hand space is remapped in an uncertainty anticipating manner while grasping and placing bottles in a virtual reality (VR) setup. To investigate, we combined the crossmodal congruency paradigm with virtual object interactions in two experiments. As expected, an anticipatory crossmodal congruency effect (aCCE) at the future finger position on the bottle was detected. Moreover, a manipulation of the visuo-motor mapping of the participants’ virtual hand while approaching the bottle selectively reduced the aCCE at movement onset. Our results support theories of event-predictive, anticipatory behavior control and active inference, showing that expected uncertainties in movement control indeed influence anticipatory stimulus processing.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Johannes Lohmann","author_id":2398374213,"num_publications":24,"num_citations":104,"affiliation_name":"University of Tübingen","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Anna Belardinelli","author_id":1896378423,"num_publications":36,"num_citations":291,"affiliation_name":"Honda","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Martin V.

As such, assessment of oculomotion is an invaluable part of a clinical examination and affords a non-invasive window on several key aspects of neuronal computation. While oculomotion is often used to detect deficits of the sort associated with vascular or neoplastic events; subtler (e.g. pharmacological) effects on neuronal processing also induce oculomotor changes. We have previously framed oculomotor control as part of active vision, namely, a process of inference comprising two distinct but related challenges. The first is inferring where to look, and the second is inferring how to implement the selected action. In this paper, we draw from recent theoretical work on the neuromodulatory control of active inference. This allows us to simulate the sort of changes we would expect in oculomotor behaviour, following pharmacological enhancement or suppression of key neuromodulators—in terms of deciding where to look and the ensuing trajectory of the eye movement itself. We focus upon the influence of cholinergic and GABAergic agents on the speed of saccades, and consider dopaminergic and noradrenergic effects on more complex, memory-guided, behaviour. In principle, a computational approach to understanding the relationship between pharmacology and oculomotor behaviour affords the opportunity to estimate the influence of a given pharmaceutical upon neuronal function, and to use this to optimise therapeutic interventions on an individual basis.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

We start from the premise that any self-organising system complies with the free energy principle, in virtue of placing an upper bound on its entropy. Crucially, the free energy principle allows one to interpret biological systems as inferring the state of their environment or external milieu. An emergent property of this inference is synchronisation among an ensemble of systems that infer each other. Here, we investigate the implications of neuronal dynamics by simulating neuronal networks, where each neuron minimises its free energy. We cast the ensuing ensemble dynamics in terms of inference and show that cardinal behaviours of neuronal networks – both in vivo and in vitro – can be explained by this framework. In particular, we test the hypotheses that (i) generalised synchrony is an emergent property of free energy minimisation; thereby explaining synchronisation in the resting brain: (ii) desynchronisation is induced by exogenous input; thereby explaining event-related desynchronisation and (iii) structure learning emerges in response to causal structure in exogenous input; thereby explaining functional segregation in real neuronal systems.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Ensor Rafael Palacios","author_id":2942802801,"num_publications":5,"num_citations":218,"affiliation_name":"University College London","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Takuya Isomura","author_id":2128696341,"num_publications":55,"num_citations":354,"affiliation_name":"Intel","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Karl J.

First, we review the extant literature on the hierarchical structure of the brain. Next, we derive the HMM from a broader evolutionary systems theory that explains neural structure and function in terms of dynamic interactions across four nested levels of biological causation (i.e., adaptation, phylogeny, ontogeny, and mechanism). We then describe how the HMM aligns with a global brain theory in neuroscience called the free-energy principle, leveraging this theory to mathematically formulate neural dynamics across hierarchical spatiotemporal scales.

Extensive evidence indicates that, after sufficient learning, living organisms develop behavioural habits that permit them saving computational resources. Furthermore, humans and other animals are able to transfer control from deliberate to habitual modes (and vice versa), trading off efficiently flexibility and parsimony – an ability that is currently unparalleled by artificial control systems. Here, we discuss a computational implementation of habit formation, and the transfer of control from deliberate to habitual modes (and vice versa) within Active Inference: a computational framework that merges aspects of cybernetic theory and of Bayesian inference. To model habit formation, we endow an Active Inference agent with a mechanism to “cache” (or memorize) policy probabilities from previous trials, and reuse them to skip – in part or in full – the inferential steps of deliberative processing. We exploit the fact that the relative quality of policies, conditioned upon hidden states, is constant over trials; provided that contingencies and prior preferences do not change. This means the only quantity that can change policy selection is the prior distribution over the initial state – where this prior is based upon the posterior beliefs from previous trials. Thus, an agent that caches the quality (or the probability) of policies can safely reuse cached values to save on cognitive and computational resources – unless contingencies change. Our simulations illustrate the computational benefits, but also the limits, of three caching schemes under Active Inference. They suggest that key aspects of habitual behaviour – such as perseveration – can be explained in terms of caching policy probabilities. Furthermore, they suggest that there may be many kinds (or stages) of habitual behaviour, each associated with a different caching scheme; for example, caching associated or not associated with contextual estimation. These schemes are more or less impervious to contextual and contingency changes.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Domenico Maisto","author_id":1981956390,"num_publications":45,"num_citations":456,"affiliation_name":"National Research Council","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Domenico Maisto","author_id":3112755283,"num_publications":12,"num_citations":133,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

We call this formulation relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS) and the anarchic brain, founded on the principle that—via their entropic effect on spontaneous cortical activity—psychedelics work to relax the precision of high-level priors or beliefs, thereby liberating bottom-up information flow, particularly via intrinsic sources such as the limbic system. We assemble evidence for this model and show how it can explain a broad range of phenomena associated with the psychedelic experience. With regard to their potential therapeutic use, we propose that psychedelics work to relax the precision weighting of pathologically overweighted priors underpinning various expressions of mental illness. We propose that this process entails an increased sensitization of high-level priors to bottom-up signaling (stemming from intrinsic sources), and that this heightened sensitivity enables the potential revision and deweighting of overweighted priors. We end by discussing further implications of the model, such as that psychedelics can bring about the revision of other heavily weighted high-level priors, not directly related to mental health, such as those underlying partisan and/or overly-confident political, religious, and/or philosophical perspectives.  Significance Statement  Psychedelics are capturing interest, with efforts underway to bring psilocybin therapy to marketing authorisation and legal access within a decade, spearheaded by the findings of a series of phase 2 trials. In this climate, a compelling unified model of how psychedelics alter brain function to alter consciousness would have appeal. Towards this end, we have sought to integrate a leading model of global brain function, hierarchical predictive coding, with an often-cited model of the acute action of psychedelics, the entropic brain hypothesis. The resulting synthesis states that psychedelics work to relax high-level priors, sensitising them to liberated bottom-up information flow, which, with the right intention, care provision and context, can help guide and cultivate the revision of entrenched pathological priors.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Robin L.

In brief, we stimulated an in vitro cortical cell culture with stimulus trains that had a known statistical structure. We then asked whether recorded neuronal responses were consistent with variational message passing based upon free energy minimisation (i.e., evidence maximisation). Effectively, this required us to solve two problems: first, we had to formulate the Bayes-optimal encoding of the causes or sources of sensory stimulation, and then show that these idealised responses could account for observed electrophysiological responses. We describe a simulation of an optimal neural network (i.e., the ideal Bayesian neural code) and then consider the mapping from idealised in silico responses to recorded in vitro responses. Our objective was to find evidence for functional specialisation and segregation in the in vitro neural network that reproduced in silico learning via free energy minimisation. Finally, we combined the in vitro and in silico results to characterise learning in terms of trajectories in a variational information plane of accuracy and complexity.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Takuya Isomura","author_id":2128696341,"num_publications":55,"num_citations":354,"affiliation_name":"Intel","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

Two modes of LC firing have been associated with distinct cognitive states: changes in tonic rates of firing are correlated with global levels of arousal and behavioural flexibility, whilst phasic LC responses are evoked by salient stimuli. Here, we unify these two modes of firing by modelling the response of the LC as a correlate of a prediction error when inferring states for action planning under Active Inference (AI). We simulate a classic Go/No-go reward learning task and a three-arm ‘explore/exploit’ task and show that, if LC activity is considered to reflect the magnitude of high level ‘state-action’ prediction errors, then both tonic and phasic modes of firing are emergent features of belief updating. We also demonstrate that when contingencies change, AI agents can update their internal models more quickly by feeding back this state-action prediction error–reflected in LC firing and noradrenaline release–to optimise learning rate, enabling large adjustments over short timescales. We propose that such prediction errors are mediated by cortico-LC connections, whilst ascending input from LC to cortex modulates belief updating in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). In short, we characterise the LC/ NA system within a general theory of brain function. In doing so, we show that contrasting, behaviour-dependent firing patterns are an emergent property of the LC that translates state-action prediction errors into an optimal balance between plasticity and stability.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Anna C.

Notably, its absence impairs the performance of tasks requiring the maintenance of information through a delay period. In this paper, we formulate a rodent task-which requires maintenance of delay-period activity-as a Markov decision process and treat optimal task performance as an (active) inference problem. We simulate the behavior of a Bayes optimal mouse presented with 1 of 2 cues that instructs the selection of concurrent visual and auditory targets on a trial-by-trial basis. Formulating inference as message passing, we reproduce features of neuronal coupling within and between prefrontal regions engaged by this task. We focus on the micro-circuitry that underwrites delay-period activity and relate it to functional specialization within the prefrontal cortex in primates. Finally, we simulate the electrophysiological correlates of inference and demonstrate the consequences of lesions to each part of our in silico prefrontal cortex. In brief, this formulation suggests that recurrent excitatory connections-which support persistent neuronal activity-encode beliefs about transition probabilities over time. We argue that attentional modulation can be understood as the contextualization of sensory input by these persistent beliefs.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Rajeev V.

Since 1880 Freud made no distinction between psychology and physiology. His papers from the end of the 1880s to1890 were very clear on this scientific overlap: as with many of its contemporaries, Freud thought about psychology essentially as the physiology of the brain. Years later he had to surrender, realizing a technological delay, not capable to pursue its ambitious aim, and until that moment psychoanalysis would have to use its more suitable clinical method. Also, he seemed skeptical about the phrenology drift, typical of that time, in which any psychological function needed to be located in its neuroanatomical area. He could not see the progresses of neurosciences and its fruitful dialogue with psychoanalysis, occurred also thanks to the improvements in the field of neuroimaging, which has made possible a remarkable advance in the knowledge of the mind-brain system and a better observation of the psychoanalytical theories. After years of investigations, deriving from research and clinical work of the last century, the discovery of neural networks, together with the free energy principle, we are observing under a new light the psychodynamic neuroscience in its exploration of the mind-brain system. In this narrative review we summarize the important developments of the psychodynamic neuroscience, with particular regard to the free energy principle, the resting state networks, especially the Default Mode Network in its link with the Self; finally we suggest a discussion by approaching the concept of Alpha Function, proposed by the psychoanalyst Wilfred Ruprecht Bion, trying to speculate about the connection with neuroscience.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Cieri","author_id":3201485471,"num_publications":5,"num_citations":35,"affiliation_name":"Lou Ruvo Brain Institute","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Filippo Cieri","author_id":1970196903,"num_publications":15,"num_citations":243,"affiliation_name":"Lou Ruvo Brain Institute","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Roberto Esposito","author_id":2570455513,"num_publications":296,"num_citations":6683,"affiliation_name":"University of Naples Federico II","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2963142467,"node_type":"seed","size":1675,"connected_edge_ids":["3138514317-2963142467","2963142467-2754844655","2963142467-2464934902","2963142467-2905018743","2963142467-2809773754","2963142467-2783657280","2963142467-2122458046"],"connected_node_ids":[3138514317,2754844655,2464934902,2905018743,2809773754,2783657280,2122458046],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2963762812,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3389/fnbot.2018.00045"},"title":"Expanding the Active Inference Landscape: More Intrinsic Motivations in the Perception-Action Loop.","year":2018,"published_date":"2018-08-30","journal":"Frontiers in Neurorobotics","abstract":"Active inference is an ambitious theory which treats perception and inference on one side, and action selection on the other side under the heading of a single principle. It also provides biologically plausible explanations for many cognitive phenomena, including consciousness. Action selection in active inference is driven by an objective function which evaluates possible future actions with respect to current, inferred beliefs about the world. Such independence from extrinsic rewards comes with a high level of robustness across e.g. different environments or agent morphologies. In the literature, more functions with these favourable properties have been summarised under the notion of intrinsic motivations. In contrast to active inference however, these formal models of motivation usually come without a commitment to particular inference and action selection mechanisms. Up to now it was not clear whether the inference and action selection machinery of active inference could also be used by alternatives to the originally included intrinsic motivation. Here we reconstruct the active inference approach, locate the original formulation within, and show how alternative intrinsic motivations can be used while keeping many of the original features intact. The perception-action loop serves as unifying formal concept to relate different components within active inference. Active inference research may profit from comparisons of the dynamics induced by alternative intrinsic motivations. Research on intrinsic motivations may profit from an additional way to implement intrinsically motivated agents that may also share the biological plausibility of active inference.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Martin Biehl","author_id":2600976870,"num_publications":41,"num_citations":222,"affiliation_name":"University of Hertfordshire","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Christian Guckelsberger","author_id":312768301,"num_publications":39,"num_citations":269,"affiliation_name":"Queen Mary University of London","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Christoph Salge","author_id":2091132454,"num_publications":82,"num_citations":719,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Simon Smith","author_id":2101781245,"num_publications":776,"num_citations":43902,"affiliation_name":"West Health","sequence_number":4},{"name":"Simón C.

In addition, hallucinations can be in-context (they can be consistent with the environment, such as when one hallucinates the end of a sentence that has been repeated many times), or out-of-context (such as the bizarre hallucinations associated with schizophrenia). In previous work, we introduced a model of hallucinations as false (positive) inferences based on a (Markov decision process) formulation of active inference. In this work, we extend this model to include content–to disclose the computational mechanisms behind in- and out-of-context hallucinations. In active inference, sensory information is used to disambiguate alternative hypotheses about the causes of sensations. Sensory information is balanced against prior beliefs, and when this balance is tipped in the favor of prior beliefs, hallucinations can occur. We show that in-context hallucinations arise when (simulated) subjects cannot use sensory information to correct prior beliefs about hearing a voice, but beliefs about content (i.e. the sequential order of a sentence) remain accurate. When hallucinating subjects also have inaccurate beliefs about state transitions, out-of-context hallucinations occur; i.e. their hallucinated speech content is disordered. Note that out-of-context hallucinations in this setting does not refer to inference about context, but rather to false perceptual inference that emerges when the confidence in–or precision of–sensory evidence is reduced. Furthermore, subjects with inaccurate beliefs about state transitions but an intact ability to use sensory information do not hallucinate and are reminiscent of prodromal patients. This work demonstrates the different computational mechanisms that may underlie the spectrum of hallucinatory experience–from the healthy population to psychotic states.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"David Benrimoh","author_id":2800876988,"num_publications":43,"num_citations":256,"affiliation_name":"McGill University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2605433224,"num_publications":37,"num_citations":1368,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":2},{"name":"Rick A.

This notion is central to active inference, a theoretical framework that treats perception and action as inferential processes. This variational perspective on cognition formalizes the notion of perception as hypothesis testing and treats actions as experiments that are designed (in part) to gather evidence for or against alternative hypotheses. The common treatment of perception and action affords a useful interpretation of certain perceptual phenomena whose active component is often not acknowledged. In this article, we start by considering Troxler fading - the dissipation of a peripheral percept during maintenance of fixation, and its recovery during free (saccadic) exploration. This offers an important example of the failure to maintain a percept without actively interrogating a visual scene. We argue that this may be understood in terms of the accumulation of uncertainty about a hypothesized stimulus when free exploration is disrupted by experimental instructions or pathology. Once we take this view, we can generalize the idea of using bodily (oculomotor) action to resolve uncertainty to include the use of mental (attentional) actions for the same purpose.

There is recent neuroscientific evidence that subjective awareness, feelings and emotions depend upon “interoception,” defined as the neural signaling to the brain from all tissues of the body. Interoception is the obvious basis of homeostasis (in the brainstem) but some interoceptive signals rise above this level and contribute to inferential processes that substantiate intrapersonal and interpersonal experience. The focus of this paper is on the essential role that their “interoception” plays in our patients’ emotional experience and subjective awareness, and how the process referred to as “mentalizing interoception” may be harnessed in therapy. This can best be understood in terms of “predictive processing,” which describes how subjective states, and particularly emotion, are inferred from sensory inputs – both interoceptive and exteroceptive. Predictive processing assumes that the brain infers (probabilistically) the likely cause of sensation experienced through the sense organs, by testing this sensory data against its innate and learned “priors.” This implies that any effort at changing heavily over-learned prior beliefs will require action upon the system that has generated that set of prior beliefs. This involves, quite literally, acting upon the world to alter inferential processes, or in the case of interoceptive priors, acting on the patient’s body to alter habitual autonomic nervous system (ANS) reflexes. Focused attention to bodily sensations/reactions, in the safety of the therapeutic relationship, provides a route to “mentalizing interoception,” by means of the bodily cues that may be the only conscious element of deeply hidden priors and thus the clearest way to access them. This can: update patients’ characteristic, dysfunctional responses to emotion and feelings; increase emotional insight; decrease cognitive distortions; and engender a more acute awareness of the present moment. These important ideas are outlined below from the perspective of psychodynamic psychotherapeutic practice, in order to discuss how relevant information from neuroscientific theory and current research can best be applied in clinical treatment. A clinical case will be presented to illustrate how this argument or treatment relates directly to clinical practice.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Patrice Duquette","author_id":2976170849,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":6,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1},{"name":"Vivien Ainley","author_id":74983668,"num_publications":17,"num_citations":588,"affiliation_name":"Royal Holloway, University of London","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2975220955,"node_type":"seed","size":1700,"connected_edge_ids":["2905018743-2975220955","2975220955-2534098824","2975220955-2551311960","2975220955-2905018743","2975220955-2463330366","2975220955-2002907081","2975220955-1180102735","2975220955-2055789905"],"connected_node_ids":[2905018743,2534098824,2551311960,2905018743,2463330366,2002907081,1180102735,2055789905],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2976482801,"pmid":"31558746","pmcid":"6763492","doi":"10.1038/s41598-019-50138-8"},"title":"Introducing a Bayesian model of selective attention based on active inference.","year":2019,"published_date":"2019-09-26","journal":"Scientific Reports","abstract":"Information gathering comprises actions whose (sensory) consequences resolve uncertainty (i.e., are salient). In other words, actions that solicit salient information cause the greatest shift in beliefs (i.e., information gain) about the causes of our sensations. However, not all information is relevant to the task at hand: this is especially the case in complex, naturalistic scenes. This paper introduces a formal model of selective attention based on active inference and contextual epistemic foraging. We consider a visual search task with a special emphasis on goal-directed and task-relevant exploration. In this scheme, attention modulates the expected fidelity (precision) of the mapping between observations and hidden states in a state-dependent or context-sensitive manner. This ensures task-irrelevant observations have little expected information gain, and so the agent – driven to reduce expected surprise (i.e., uncertainty) – does not actively seek them out. Instead, it selectively samples task-relevant observations, which inform (task-relevant) hidden states. We further show, through simulations, that the atypical exploratory behaviours in conditions such as autism and anxiety may be due to a failure to appropriately modulate sensory precision in a context-specific way.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"M.

The fit between this model and data may be improved in two ways. The brain could optimise probabilistic beliefs about the variables in the generative model (i.e. perceptual inference). Alternatively, by acting on the world, it could change the sensory data, such that they are more consistent with the model. This implies a common objective function (variational free energy) for action and perception that scores the fit between an internal model and the world. We compare two free energy functionals for active inference in the framework of Markov decision processes. One of these is a functional of beliefs (i.e. probability distributions) about states and policies, but a function of observations, while the second is a functional of beliefs about all three. In the former (expected free energy), prior beliefs about outcomes are not part of the generative model (because they are absorbed into the prior over policies). Conversely, in the second (generalised free energy), priors over outcomes become an explicit component of the generative model. When using the free energy function, which is blind to future observations, we equip the generative model with a prior over policies that ensure preferred (i.e. priors over) outcomes are realised. In other words, if we expect to encounter a particular kind of outcome, this lends plausibility to those policies for which this outcome is a consequence. In addition, this formulation ensures that selected policies minimise uncertainty about future outcomes by minimising the free energy expected in the future. When using the free energy functional-that effectively treats future observations as hidden states-we show that policies are inferred or selected that realise prior preferences by minimising the free energy of future expectations. Interestingly, the form of posterior beliefs about policies (and associated belief updating) turns out to be identical under both formulations, but the quantities used to compute them are not.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

It has been known that sensory deficits worsen the standing balance. However, how the modulation of sensory information contributes to postural stabilization still remains an open question for researchers. The purpose of this work was to formulate the human standing postural control system in the framework of the free-energy principle, and to investigate the efficacy of the skin stretch feedback in enhancing the human standing balance. Previously, we have shown that sensory augmentation by skin stretch feedback at the fingertip could modulate the standing balance of the people with simulated sensory deficits. In this study, subjects underwent ten 30-second trials of quiet standing balance with and without skin stretch feedback. Visual and vestibular sensory deficits were simulated by having each subject close their eyes and tilt their head back. We found that sensory augmentation by velocity-based skin stretch feedback at the fingertip reduced the entropy of the standing postural sway of the people with simulated sensory deficits. This result aligns with the framework of the free energy principle which states that a self-organizing biological system at its equilibrium state tries to minimize its free energy either by updating the internal state or by correcting body movement with appropriate actions. The velocity-based skin stretch feedback at the fingertip may increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensory signals, which in turn enhances the accuracy of the internal states in the central nervous system. With more accurate internal states, the human postural control system can further adjust the standing posture to minimize the entropy, and thus the free energy.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Pilwon Hur","author_id":1516564177,"num_publications":52,"num_citations":499,"affiliation_name":"Texas A&M University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Yi-Tsen Pan","author_id":2548000262,"num_publications":6,"num_citations":27,"affiliation_name":"Texas A&M University","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Christian DeBuys","author_id":2900408240,"num_publications":3,"num_citations":5,"affiliation_name":"Texas A&M University","sequence_number":3}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":2986148895,"node_type":"seed","size":1500,"connected_edge_ids":[],"connected_node_ids":[],"cluster_id":10,"alternate_cluster_id":0},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":2989729815,"pmid":"31756340","pmcid":null,"doi":"10.1016/j.jtbi.2019.110089"},"title":"On Markov blankets and hierarchical self-organisation","year":2020,"published_date":"2020-02-07","journal":"Journal of Theoretical Biology","abstract":"Abstract   Biological self-organisation can be regarded as a process of spontaneous pattern formation; namely, the emergence of structures that distinguish themselves from their environment. This process can occur at nested spatial scales: from the microscopic (e.g., the emergence of cells) to the macroscopic (e.g. the emergence of organisms). In this paper, we pursue the idea that Markov blankets – that separate the internal states of a structure from external states – can self-assemble at successively higher levels of organisation. Using simulations, based on the principle of variational free energy minimisation, we show that hierarchical self-organisation emerges when the microscopic elements of an ensemble have prior (e.g., genetic) beliefs that they participate in a macroscopic Markov blanket: i.e., they can only influence – or be influenced by – a subset of other elements. Furthermore, the emergent structures look very much like those found in nature (e.g., cells or organelles), when influences are mediated by short range signalling. These simulations are offered as a proof of concept that hierarchical self-organisation of Markov blankets (into Markov blankets) can explain the self-evidencing, autopoietic behaviour of biological systems.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Ensor Rafael Palacios","author_id":2942802801,"num_publications":5,"num_citations":218,"affiliation_name":"University College London","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Adeel Razi","author_id":2109536171,"num_publications":140,"num_citations":3242,"affiliation_name":"UCL Institute of Neurology","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Michael D.

We formulate responses to stressful scenarios in terms of Bayesian belief-updating and subsequent policy selection; namely, planning as (active) inference. Using a minimal model of how creatures or subjects account for their sensations (and subsequent action), we deconstruct the sequences of belief updating and behaviour that underwrite stress-related responses – and simulate the aberrant responses of the sort seen in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Crucially, the model used for belief-updating generates predictions in multiple (exteroceptive, proprioceptive and interoceptive) modalities, to provide an integrated account of evidence accumulation and multimodal integration that has consequences for both motor and autonomic responses. The ensuing phenomenology speaks to many constructs in the ecological and clinical literature on stress, which we unpack with reference to simulated inference processes and accompanying neuronal responses. A key insight afforded by this formal approach rests on the trade-off between the epistemic affordance of certain cues (that resolve uncertainty about states of affairs in the environment) and the consequences of epistemic foraging (that may be in conflict with the instrumental or pragmatic value of ‘fleeing’ or ‘freezing’). Starting from first principles, we show how this trade-off is nuanced by prior (subpersonal) beliefs about the outcomes of behaviour – beliefs that, when held with unduly high precision, can lead to (Bayes optimal) responses that closely resemble PTSD.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Adam Linson","author_id":2510977556,"num_publications":21,"num_citations":118,"affiliation_name":"Open University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Adam Linson","author_id":2953969713,"num_publications":3,"num_citations":28,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Karl J.

All computational decision-making models contain a mechanism that controls the variability of (or confidence in) action selection, but its neural implementation is unclear-especially in humans. We investigated this mechanism using two influential decision-making frameworks: active inference (AI) and reinforcement learning (RL). In AI, the precision (inverse variance) of beliefs about policies controls action selection variability-similar to decision 'noise' parameters in RL-and is thought to be encoded by striatal dopamine signaling. We tested this hypothesis by administering a 'go/no-go' task to 75 healthy participants, and measuring striatal dopamine 2/3 receptor (D2/3R) availability in a subset (n = 25) using [11C]-(+)-PHNO positron emission tomography. In behavioral model comparison, RL performed best across the whole group but AI performed best in participants performing above chance levels. Limbic striatal D2/3R availability had linear relationships with AI policy precision (P = 0.029) as well as with RL irreducible decision 'noise' (P = 0.020), and this relationship with D2/3R availability was confirmed with a 'decision stochasticity' factor that aggregated across both models (P = 0.0006). These findings are consistent with occupancy of inhibitory striatal D2/3Rs decreasing the variability of action selection in humans.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Rick A.

Although apathy is common and detrimental to prognosis in many neuropsychiatric diseases, its underlying mechanisms remain controversial. We propose a new model of apathy, in the context of Bayesian theories of brain function, whereby actions require predictions of their outcomes to be held with sufficient precision for \"explaining away\" differences in sensory inputs. In the active inference model, apathy results from reduced precision of prior beliefs about action outcomes. We tested this hypothesis using a visuomotor task in healthy adults (N = 47), with experimental manipulation of physical effort and financial reward. Bayesian modeling of performance and participants' perception of their performance was used to infer the precision of their priors. We confirmed that the perception of performance was biased toward the target, which was accounted for by relatively precise prior beliefs about action outcomes. These priors were consistently more precise than the corresponding performance distribution, and were scaled to effort and reward. Crucially, prior precision was negatively associated with trait apathy, suggesting that apathetic individuals had less precise prior beliefs about action outcomes. The results support a Bayesian account of apathy that could inform future studies of clinical populations.

Here, we asked whether increasing attention to (i.e., the precision of) vision or proprioception would enhance performance in a hand-target phase matching task, in which visual and proprioceptive cues about hand posture were incongruent. We show that in a simple simulated agent—based on predictive coding formulations of active inference—increasing the expected precision of vision or proprioception improved task performance (target matching with the seen or felt hand, respectively) under visuo-proprioceptive conflict. Moreover, we show that this formulation captured the behaviour and self-reported attentional allocation of human participants performing the same task in a virtual reality environment.

One way this manifests is in cooperative communication; that is, intentional communication aimed at aligning individuals’ mental states with respect to events in their shared environment. This idea has received strong empirical support. The purpose of this paper is to extend this account by proposing an integrative model of the biobehavioral dynamics of cooperative communication. Our formulation is based on active inference. Active inference suggests that action-perception cycles operate to minimize uncertainty and optimize an individual’s internal model of the world. We propose that humans are characterized by an evolved adaptive prior belief that their mental states are aligned with, or similar to, those of conspecifics (i.e., that ‘we are the same sort of creature, inhabiting the same sort of niche’). The use of cooperative communication emerges as the principal means to gather evidence for this belief, allowing for the development of a shared narrative that is used to disambiguate interactants’ (hidden and inferred) mental states. Thus, by using cooperative communication, individuals effectively attune to a hermeneutic niche composed, in part, of others’ mental states; and, reciprocally, attune the niche to their own ends via epistemic niche construction. This means that niche construction enables features of the niche to encode precise, reliable cues about the deontic or shared value of certain action policies (e.g., the utility of using communicative constructions to disambiguate mental states, given expectations about shared prior beliefs). In turn, the alignment of mental states (prior beliefs) enables the emergence of a novel, contextualizing scale of cultural dynamics that encompasses the actions and mental states of the ensemble of interactants and their shared environment. The dynamics of this contextualizing layer of cultural organization feedback, across scales, to constrain the variability of the prior expectations of the individuals who constitute it. Our theory additionally builds upon the active inference literature by introducing a new set of neurobiologically plausible computational hypotheses for cooperative communication. We conclude with directions for future research.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Jared Vasil","author_id":2953469378,"num_publications":3,"num_citations":15,"affiliation_name":"Duke University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Paul B.

However, it remains unclear how such models can be learned in practice. The open-ended complexity of natural environments means that it is generally infeasible for organisms to model their environment comprehensively. Alternatively, action-oriented models attempt to encode a parsimonious representation of adaptive agent-environment interactions. One approach to learning action-oriented models is to learn online in the presence of goal-directed behaviours. This constrains an agent to behaviourally relevant trajectories, reducing the diversity of the data a model need account for. Unfortunately, this approach can cause models to prematurely converge to sub-optimal solutions, through a process we refer to as a bad-bootstrap. Here, we exploit the normative framework of active inference to show that efficient action-oriented models can be learned by balancing goal-oriented and epistemic (information-seeking) behaviours in a principled manner. We illustrate our approach using a simple agent-based model of bacterial chemotaxis. We first demonstrate that learning via goal-directed behaviour indeed constrains models to behaviorally relevant aspects of the environment, but that this approach is prone to sub-optimal convergence. We then demonstrate that epistemic behaviours facilitate the construction of accurate and comprehensive models, but that these models are not tailored to any specific behavioural niche and are therefore less efficient in their use of data. Finally, we show that active inference agents learn models that are parsimonious, tailored to action, and which avoid bad bootstraps and sub-optimal convergence. Critically, our results indicate that models learned through active inference can support adaptive behaviour in spite of, and indeed because of, their departure from veridical representations of the environment. Our approach provides a principled method for learning adaptive models from limited interactions with an environment, highlighting a route to sample efficient learning algorithms.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Alexander Tschantz","author_id":2972501046,"num_publications":27,"num_citations":281,"affiliation_name":"University of Sussex","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Anil K.

Using the free energy principle, which bridges information theory and Bayesian inference, we derive a maximum entropy model of people’s internal representations of the transitions between stimuli. Importantly, our model (i) affords a concise analytic form, (ii) qualitatively explains the effects of transition network structure on human expectations, and (iii) quantitatively predicts human reaction times in probabilistic sequential motor tasks. Together, these results suggest that mental errors influence our abstract representations of the world in significant and predictable ways, with direct implications for the study and design of optimally learnable information sources.

However, the functional importance of noise remains unknown. n particular, from a computational perspective, such stochasticity is potentially harmful to brain function. In machine learning, a large number of saddle points are surrounded by high error plateaus and give the illusion of the existence of local minimum. As a result, being trapped in the saddle points can dramatically impair learning and adding noise will attack such saddle point problems in high-dimensional optimization, especially under the strict saddle condition. Motivated by these arguments, we propose one biologically plausible noise structure and demonstrate that noise can efficiently improve the optimization performance of spiking neural networks based on stochastic gradient descent. The strict saddle condition for synaptic plasticity is deduced, and under such conditions, noise can help optimization escape from saddle points on high dimensional domains. The theoretical results explain the stochasticity of synapses and guide us on how to make use of noise. In addition, we provide biological interpretations of proposed noise structures from two points: one based on the free energy principle in neuroscience and another based on observations of in vivo experiments. Our simulation results manifest that in the learning and test phase, the accuracy of synaptic sampling with noise is almost 20% higher than that without noise for synthesis dataset, and the gain in accuracy with/without noise is at least 10% for the MNIST and CIFAR-10 dataset. Our study provides a new learning framework for the brain and sheds new light on deep noisy spiking neural networks.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Ying Fang","author_id":2800196478,"num_publications":5,"num_citations":44,"affiliation_name":"Tsinghua University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Zhaofei Yu","author_id":3023911826,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":0,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":2},{"name":"Zhaofei Yu","author_id":3019895611,"num_publications":3,"num_citations":1,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":2},{"name":"Feng Chen","author_id":2710793166,"num_publications":109,"num_citations":2302,"affiliation_name":"Tsinghua University","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Feng Chen","author_id":3037094000,"num_publications":73,"num_citations":1411,"affiliation_name":"Tsinghua University","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Feng Chen","author_id":2422516832,"num_publications":146,"num_citations":3305,"affiliation_name":"Tsinghua University","sequence_number":3}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3023496026,"node_type":"seed","size":1525,"connected_edge_ids":["3023496026-2002907081"],"connected_node_ids":[2002907081],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3024694296,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00404"},"title":"A Computational Theory of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy from the \"Bayesian Brain\" Perspective.","year":2020,"published_date":"2020-05-15","journal":"Frontiers in Psychiatry","abstract":"Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) was developed to combine methods from cognitive behavioral therapy and meditative techniques, with the specific goal of preventing relapse in recurrent depression.

This article introduces a testable theory about the computational mechanisms behind MBCT that is grounded in “Bayesian brain” concepts of perception from cognitive neuroscience, such as predictive coding. These concepts regard the brain as embodying a model of its environment (including the external world and the body) which predicts future sensory inputs and is updated by prediction errors, depending on how precise these error signals are. This article offers a concrete proposal how core concepts of MBCT – (i) the being mode (accepting whatever sensations arise, without judging or changing them), (ii) decentering (experiencing thoughts and percepts simply as events in the mind that arise and pass), and (iii) cognitive reactivity (changes in mood reactivate negative beliefs) – could be understood in terms of perceptual and metacognitive processes that draw on specific computational mechanisms of the “Bayesian brain”. Importantly, the proposed theory can be tested experimentally, using a combination of behavioral paradigms, computational modelling, and neuroimaging.

Smooth arm movements require predictions (inference) about the force-field associated with a workspace. The Free Energy Principle (FEP) suggests that such ‘active inference’ is driven by ‘surprise’. We used these insights to create a formal model that explains why disturbance might help learning. In two experiments, participants undertook a continuous tracking task where they learned how to move their arm in different directions through a novel 3D force field. We compared baseline performance before and after exposure to the novel field to quantify learning. In Experiment 1, the exposure phases (but not the baseline measures) were delivered under three different conditions: (i) robot haptic assistance; (ii) no guidance; (iii) robot haptic disturbance. The disturbance group showed the best learning as our model predicted. Experiment 2 further tested our FEP inspired model. Assistive and/or disturbance forces were applied as a function of performance (low surprise), and compared to a random error manipulation (high surprise). The random group showed the most improvement as predicted by the model. Thus, motor learning can be conceptualised as a process of entropy reduction. Short term motor strategies (e.g. global impedance) can mitigate unexpected perturbations, but continuous movements require active inference about external force-fields in order to create accurate internal models of the external world (motor learning). Our findings reconcile research on the relationship between noise, variability, and motor learning, and show that information is the currency of motor learning.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Jack Brookes","author_id":2745027558,"num_publications":12,"num_citations":62,"affiliation_name":"University of Leeds","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Faisal Mushtaq","author_id":2122284425,"num_publications":78,"num_citations":625,"affiliation_name":"University of Leeds","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Earle Jamieson","author_id":2978115305,"num_publications":4,"num_citations":5,"affiliation_name":"University of Leeds","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Aaron Fath","author_id":2090549336,"num_publications":23,"num_citations":96,"affiliation_name":"Indiana University","sequence_number":4},{"name":"Geoffrey P.

Concept learning is one primary example, which requires both a type of internal model expansion process (adding novel hidden states that explain new observations), and a model reduction process (merging different states into one underlying cause and thus reducing model complexity via meta-learning). Although various algorithmic models of concept learning have been proposed within machine learning and cognitive science, many are limited to various degrees by an inability to generalize, the need for very large amounts of training data, and/or insufficiently established biological plausibility. Using concept learning as an example case, we introduce a novel approach for modeling structure learning-and specifically state-space expansion and reduction-within the active inference framework and its accompanying neural process theory. Our aim is to demonstrate its potential to facilitate a novel line of active inference research in this area. The approach we lay out is based on the idea that a generative model can be equipped with extra (hidden state or cause) \"slots\" that can be engaged when an agent learns about novel concepts. This can be combined with a Bayesian model reduction process, in which any concept learning-associated with these slots-can be reset in favor of a simpler model with higher model evidence. We use simulations to illustrate this model's ability to add new concepts to its state space (with relatively few observations) and increase the granularity of the concepts it currently possesses.

Although deliberately simple, these simulation results highlight ways in which active inference could offer useful resources in developing neurocomputational models of structure learning.

Degeneracy finds a powerful role in neuroscience, explaining key aspects of distributed processing and structure-function relationships in the brain. For example, degeneracy accounts for the superadditive effect of lesions on functional deficits in terms of a \"many-to-one\" structure-function mapping. In this paper, we offer a principled account of degeneracy and redundancy, when function is operationalized in terms of active inference, namely, a formulation of perception and action as belief updating under generative models of the world. In brief, \"degeneracy\" is quantified by the \"entropy\" of posterior beliefs about the causes of sensations, while \"redundancy\" is the \"complexity\" cost incurred by forming those beliefs. From this perspective, degeneracy and redundancy are complementary: Active inference tries to minimize redundancy while maintaining degeneracy. This formulation is substantiated using statistical and mathematical notions of degenerate mappings and statistical efficiency. We then illustrate changes in degeneracy and redundancy during the learning of a word repetition task. Finally, we characterize the effects of lesions-to intrinsic and extrinsic connections-using in silico disconnections. These numerical analyses highlight the fundamental difference between degeneracy and redundancy-and how they score distinct imperatives for perceptual inference and structure learning that are relevant to synthetic and biological intelligence.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Noor Sajid","author_id":2975983068,"num_publications":27,"num_citations":252,"affiliation_name":"UCL Institute of Neurology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":3131355596,"num_publications":6,"num_citations":60,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":2},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":3185102216,"num_publications":9,"num_citations":64,"affiliation_name":"UCL Institute of Neurology","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":3159577960,"num_publications":9,"num_citations":64,"affiliation_name":"UCL Institute of Neurology","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2605433224,"num_publications":37,"num_citations":1368,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":2},{"name":"Thomas M.

Building on active inference formulations of dyadic interactions, we simulate linguistic exchange to explore generative models that support dialogues. These models employ high-order interactions among abstract (discrete) states in deep (hierarchical) models. The sequential nature of language processing mandates generative models with a particular factorial structure—necessary to accommodate the rich combinatorics of language. We illustrate linguistic communication by simulating a synthetic subject who can play the ‘Twenty Questions’ game. In this game, synthetic subjects take the role of the questioner or answerer, using the same generative model. This simulation setup is used to illustrate some key architectural points and demonstrate that many behavioural and neurophysiological correlates of linguistic communication emerge under variational (marginal) message passing, given the right kind of generative model. For example, we show that theta-gamma coupling is an emergent property of belief updating, when listening to another.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Karl J.

From Variational Density Dynamics to Neural and Phenotypic Representations","year":2020,"published_date":"2020-08-13","journal":"Entropy","abstract":"The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) to assess whether the construct of neural representations plays an explanatory role under the variational free-energy principle and its corollary process theory, active inference; and (2) if so, to assess which philosophical stance—in relation to the ontological and epistemological status of representations—is most appropriate. We focus on non-realist (deflationary and fictionalist-instrumentalist) approaches. We consider a deflationary account of mental representation, according to which the explanatorily relevant contents of neural representations are mathematical, rather than cognitive, and a fictionalist or instrumentalist account, according to which representations are scientifically useful fictions that serve explanatory (and other) aims. After reviewing the free-energy principle and active inference, we argue that the model of adaptive phenotypes under the free-energy principle can be used to furnish a formal semantics, enabling us to assign semantic content to specific phenotypic states (the internal states of a Markovian system that exists far from equilibrium). We propose a modified fictionalist account—an organism-centered fictionalism or instrumentalism. We argue that, under the free-energy principle, pursuing even a deflationary account of the content of neural representations licenses the appeal to the kind of semantic content involved in the ‘aboutness’ or intentionality of cognitive systems; our position is thus coherent with, but rests on distinct assumptions from, the realist position. We argue that the free-energy principle thereby explains the aboutness or intentionality in living systems and hence their capacity to parse their sensory stream using an ontology or set of semantic factors.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Maxwell J.

We employ Karl Friston's free-energy principle to show how this phenomenological concept of mood can be smoothly integrated with cognitive neuroscience. We will argue that mood is a consequence of acting in the world with the aim of minimizing expected free energy-a measure of uncertainty about the future consequences of actions. Moods summarize how the organism is faring overall in its predictive engagements, tuning the organism's expectations about how it is likely to fare in the future. Agents that act to minimize expected free energy will have a feeling of how well or badly they are doing at maintaining grip on the multiple possibilities that matter to them. They will have what we will call a 'feeling of grip' that structures the possibilities they are ready to engage with over long time-scales, just as moods do.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Julian Kiverstein","author_id":787502387,"num_publications":72,"num_citations":1554,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Mark Miller","author_id":2998684661,"num_publications":9,"num_citations":42,"affiliation_name":"University of Sussex","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Erik Rietveld","author_id":2133004025,"num_publications":66,"num_citations":2086,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":3}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3049709870,"node_type":"seed","size":1800,"connected_edge_ids":["3049709870-2115460576","3049709870-2789154098","3049709870-2128918015","3049709870-2002907081","3049709870-2769704218","3049709870-2055789905","3049709870-2564601941","3049709870-1979732124","3049709870-2137411342","3049709870-2208959019","3049709870-2534098824","3049709870-2953421850","3096810469-3049709870","3210700158-3049709870","3196481983-3049709870"],"connected_node_ids":[2115460576,2789154098,2128918015,2002907081,2769704218,2055789905,2564601941,1979732124,2137411342,2208959019,2534098824,2953421850,3096810469,3210700158,3196481983],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3083520193,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3389/frai.2020.00069"},"title":"A Bayesian Account of Generalist and Specialist Formation Under the Active Inference Framework.","year":2020,"published_date":null,"journal":null,"abstract":"This paper offers a formal account of policy learning, or habitual behavioural optimisation, under the framework of Active Inference. In this setting, habit formation becomes an autodidactic, experience-dependent process, based upon what the agent sees itself doing. We focus on the effect of environmental volatility on habit formation by simulating artificial agents operating in a partially observable Markov decision process. Specifically, we used a ‘two-step’ maze paradigm, in which the agent has to decide whether to go left or right to secure a reward. We observe that in volatile environments with numerous reward locations, the agents learn to adopt a generalist strategy, never forming a strong habitual behaviour for any preferred maze direction. Conversely, in conservative or static environments, agents adopt a specialist strategy; forming strong preferences for policies that result in approach to a small number of previously-observed reward locations. The pros and cons of the two strategies are tested and discussed. In general, specialization offers greater benefits, but only when contingencies are conserved over time. We consider the implications of this formal (Active Inference) account of policy learning for understanding the relationship between specialisation and habit formation.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Anthony Guanxun Chen","author_id":2947120763,"num_publications":3,"num_citations":19,"affiliation_name":"McGill University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"David Benrimoh","author_id":2800876988,"num_publications":43,"num_citations":256,"affiliation_name":"McGill University","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Karl J.

While initial formulations of ASAP and GAE explain different aspects of beat-based timing—the involvement of motor structures in the absence of movement, and physical entrainment to an auditory beat respectively—we suggest that work under both hypotheses provide converging evidence toward understanding the predictive role of the motor system in the perception of rhythm, and the specific neural mechanisms involved.

While symptomatology is traditionally divided into positive and negative symptoms, abnormal social cognition is now recognized a key component of schizophrenia. Nonetheless, we are still lacking a mechanistic understanding of effective brain connectivity in schizophrenia during social cognition and how it relates to clinical symptomatology. To address this question, we used fMRI and dynamic causal modelling (DCM) to test for abnormal brain connectivity in twenty-four patients with first-episode schizophrenia (FES) compared to twenty-five matched controls performing the Human Connectome Project (HCP) social cognition paradigm. Patients had not received regular therapeutic antipsychotics, but were not completely drug naive. Whilst patients were less accurate than controls in judging social stimuli from non-social stimuli, our results revealed an increase in feedforward connectivity from motion-sensitive V5 to posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) in patients compared to matched controls. At the same time, patients with a higher degree of positive symptoms had more disinhibition within pSTS, a region computationally involved in social cognition. We interpret these findings the framework of active inference, where increased feedforward connectivity may encode aberrant prediction errors from V5 to pSTS and local disinhibition within pSTS may reflect aberrant encoding of the precision of cortical representations about social stimuli.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Martin J.

The findings suggested an active confirmation bias. Here, we examine whether this influence from prediction depends on the evaluative polarization of the food images. Specifically, we divided the set of food images into \"strong\" and \"mild\" images by how polarized (i.e., extreme) their average ratings were across all conditions. With respect to the influence from prediction, we raise two alternative hypotheses. According to a predictive dissonance hypothesis, the larger the discrepancy between prediction and outcome, the stronger the active inference toward accommodating the outcome with the prediction; thus, the confirmation bias should obtain particularly with strong images. Conversely, according to a nudging-in-volatility hypothesis, the active confirmation bias operates only on images within a dynamic range, where the values of images are volatile, and not on the evaluation of images that are too obviously appetitive or aversive; accordingly, the effects from prediction should occur predominately with mild images. Across the data from two experiments, we found that the evaluation of mild images tended to exhibit the confirmation bias, with ratings that followed the direction given by the prediction. For strong images, there was no confirmation bias. Our findings corroborate the nudging-in-volatility hypothesis, suggesting that predictive cues may be able to tip the balance of evaluation particularly for food images that do not have a strongly polarized value.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Kajornvut Ounjai","author_id":2775557639,"num_publications":14,"num_citations":59,"affiliation_name":"King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Lalida Suppaso","author_id":2939593807,"num_publications":2,"num_citations":1,"affiliation_name":"King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Jakob Hohwy","author_id":663984019,"num_publications":163,"num_citations":3893,"affiliation_name":"Monash University, Clayton campus","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Johan Marc Jose Lauwereyns","author_id":1706933381,"num_publications":64,"num_citations":1610,"affiliation_name":"Kyushu University","sequence_number":4}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3092153537,"node_type":"seed","size":1500,"connected_edge_ids":[],"connected_node_ids":[],"cluster_id":13,"alternate_cluster_id":0},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3094274776,"pmid":"33096824","pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/bs10100161"},"title":"Neuromodulatory Control and Language Recovery in Bilingual Aphasia: An Active Inference Approach.","year":2020,"published_date":null,"journal":"Systems Research and Behavioral Science","abstract":"Understanding the aetiology of the diverse recovery patterns in bilingual aphasia is a theoretical challenge with implications for treatment. Loss of control over intact language networks provides a parsimonious starting point that can be tested using in-silico lesions. We simulated a complex recovery pattern (alternate antagonism and paradoxical translation) to test the hypothesis—from an established hierarchical control model—that loss of control was mediated by constraints on neuromodulatory resources. We used active (Bayesian) inference to simulate a selective loss of sensory precision; i.e., confidence in the causes of sensations. This in-silico lesion altered the precision of beliefs about task relevant states, including appropriate actions, and reproduced exactly the recovery pattern of interest. As sensory precision has been linked to acetylcholine release, these simulations endorse the conjecture that loss of neuromodulatory control can explain this atypical recovery pattern. We discuss the relevance of this finding for other recovery patterns.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Noor Sajid","author_id":2975983068,"num_publications":27,"num_citations":252,"affiliation_name":"UCL Institute of Neurology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Karl J.

We used computational modelling to examine 2 factors that are often not distinguished in descriptive analyses of AAC: decision uncertainty and sensitivity to negative outcomes versus rewards (emotional conflict). METHODS A previously validated AAC task was completed by 478 participants, including healthy controls (n = 59), people with substance use disorders (n = 159) and people with depression and/or anxiety disorders who did not have substance use disorders (n = 260). Using an active inference model, we estimated individual-level values for a model parameter that reflected decision uncertainty and another that reflected emotional conflict. We also repeated analyses in a subsample (59 healthy controls, 161 people with depression and/or anxiety disorders, 56 people with substance use disorders) that was propensity-matched for age and general intelligence. RESULTS The model showed high accuracy (72%). As further validation, parameters correlated with reaction times and self-reported task motivations in expected directions. The emotional conflict parameter further correlated with self-reported anxiety during the task (r = 0.32, p < 0.001), and the decision uncertainty parameter correlated with self-reported difficulty making decisions (r = 0.45, p < 0.001). Compared to healthy controls, people with depression and/or anxiety disorders and people with substance use disorders showed higher decision uncertainty in the propensity-matched sample (t = 2.16, p = 0.03, and t = 2.88, p = 0.005, respectively), with analogous results in the full sample; people with substance use disorders also showed lower emotional conflict in the full sample (t = 3.17, p = 0.002). LIMITATIONS This study was limited by heterogeneity of the clinical sample and an inability to examine learning. CONCLUSION These results suggest that reduced confidence in how to act, rather than increased emotional conflict, may explain maladaptive approach-avoidance behaviours in people with psychiatric disorders.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Smith","author_id":2238016832,"num_publications":130,"num_citations":1866,"affiliation_name":"McGovern Institute for Brain Research","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Namik Kirlic","author_id":3113906704,"num_publications":2,"num_citations":17,"affiliation_name":"College of Health Sciences, Bahrain","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Namik Kirlic","author_id":2581074054,"num_publications":41,"num_citations":355,"affiliation_name":"College of Health Sciences, Bahrain","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Namik Kirlic","author_id":3189740175,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":13,"affiliation_name":"College of Health Sciences, Bahrain","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Jennifer L.

From its inception, its associated process theory has grown to incorporate complex generative models, enabling simulation of a wide range of complex behaviours. Due to successive developments in active inference, it is often difficult to see how its underlying principle relates to process theories and practical implementation. In this paper, we try to bridge this gap by providing a complete mathematical synthesis of active inference on discrete state-space models. This technical summary provides an overview of the theory, derives neuronal dynamics from first principles and relates this dynamics to biological processes. Furthermore, this paper provides a fundamental building block needed to understand active inference for mixed generative models; allowing continuous sensations to inform discrete representations. This paper may be used as follows: to guide research towards outstanding challenges, a practical guide on how to implement active inference to simulate experimental behaviour, or a pointer towards various in-silico neurophysiological responses that may be used to make empirical predictions.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Lancelot Da Costa","author_id":3000924792,"num_publications":23,"num_citations":263,"affiliation_name":"Imperial College London","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Noor Sajid","author_id":2975983068,"num_publications":27,"num_citations":252,"affiliation_name":"UCL Institute of Neurology","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Sebastijan Veselic","author_id":3007799603,"num_publications":8,"num_citations":88,"affiliation_name":"University College London","sequence_number":4},{"name":"Victorita Neacsu","author_id":2783199413,"num_publications":6,"num_citations":120,"affiliation_name":"University College London","sequence_number":5},{"name":"Karl J.

Active inference might underpin the way organisms act and observe in the real world. In active inference, agents act in order to minimize their so called free energy, or prediction error. Besides being biologically plausible, active inference has been shown to solve hard exploration problems in various simulations. However, these simulations typically require handcrafting a generative model for the agent. Therefore we propose to use recent advances in deep artificial neural networks to learn generative state space models from scratch, using only observation-action sequences. This way we are able to scale active inference to new and challenging problem domains, whilst still building on the theoretical backing of the free energy principle. We validate our approach on the mountain car problem to illustrate that our learnt models can indeed trade-off instrumental value and ambiguity. Furthermore, we show that generative models can also be learnt using high-dimensional pixel observations, both in the OpenAI Gym car racing environment and a real-world robotic navigation task.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Ozan Çatal","author_id":2935739949,"num_publications":24,"num_citations":92,"affiliation_name":"Ghent University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Samuel Wauthier","author_id":3009461867,"num_publications":8,"num_citations":22,"affiliation_name":"Ghent University","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Cedric De Boom","author_id":2287307189,"num_publications":44,"num_citations":346,"affiliation_name":"Ghent University","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Tim Verbelen","author_id":1192672773,"num_publications":106,"num_citations":1213,"affiliation_name":"IMEC","sequence_number":4},{"name":"Bart Dhoedt","author_id":3216895213,"num_publications":44,"num_citations":192,"affiliation_name":"Ghent University","sequence_number":5},{"name":"Bart Dhoedt","author_id":1990677562,"num_publications":607,"num_citations":6485,"affiliation_name":"Information Technology University","sequence_number":5}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3098317736,"node_type":"seed","size":1775,"connected_edge_ids":["3134399927-3098317736","3098317736-2606488938","3098317736-2929539807","3098317736-2004652753","3098317736-2424475825","3098317736-2525228457","3098317736-2892266804","3098317736-2463330366","3098317736-2137411342","3098317736-2055789905","3098317736-2623066203"],"connected_node_ids":[3134399927,2606488938,2929539807,2004652753,2424475825,2525228457,2892266804,2463330366,2137411342,2055789905,2623066203],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3101221933,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.1007/s00422-014-0620-8"},"title":"Active inference, eye movements and oculomotor delays","year":2016,"published_date":null,"journal":"arXiv: Neurons and Cognition","abstract":"This paper considers the problem of sensorimotor delays in the optimal control of (smooth) eye movements under uncertainty. Specifically, we consider delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filtering to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalized coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalized coordinates provides a simple way of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. The efficacy of this scheme is illustrated using neuronal simulations of pursuit initiation responses, with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the gener-ative model to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements - in which the visuo-oculomotor system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted to a (hidden) point moving in the visual field. Finally, the generative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can recognise and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from different sources with different temporal delays and the particular difficulties encountered when a system - like the oculomotor system - tries to control its environment with delayed signals.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Laurent Perrinet","author_id":2017857339,"num_publications":141,"num_citations":2219,"affiliation_name":"Centre national de la recherche scientifique","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Rick A.

Although how agents can resolve such problems autonomously has not been determined, dynamic characteristics of agency may shed light on underlying mechanisms. The current study focused on the sense of agency (SoA), a specific aspect of agency referring to congruence between the agent's intention in acting and the outcome. Employing predictive coding and active inference as theoretical frameworks of perception and action generation, we hypothesize that regulation of complexity in the evidence lower bound of an agent's model should affect the strength of the agent's SoA and should have a critical impact on social interactions. We built a computational model of imitative interaction between a robot and a human via visuo-proprioceptive sensation with a variational Bayes recurrent neural network, and simulated the model in the form of pseudo-imitative interaction using recorded human body movement data. A key feature of the model is that each modality's complexity can be regulated differently with a hyperparameter assigned to each module. We first searched for an optimal setting that endows the model with appropriate coordination of multimodal sensation. This revealed that the vision module's complexity should be more tightly regulated than that of the proprioception module. Using the optimally trained model, we examined how changing the tightness of complexity regulation after training affects the strength of the SoA during interactions. The results showed that with looser regulation, an agent tends to act more egocentrically, without adapting to the other. In contrast, with tighter regulation, the agent tends to follow the other by adjusting its intention. We conclude that the tightness of complexity regulation crucially affects the strength of the SoA and the dynamics of interactions between agents.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Wataru Ohata","author_id":3004760905,"num_publications":5,"num_citations":14,"affiliation_name":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Jun Tani","author_id":1989802913,"num_publications":286,"num_citations":4861,"affiliation_name":"Waseda University","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3101413036,"node_type":"seed","size":1550,"connected_edge_ids":["3101413036-2137411342","3101413036-2787984105"],"connected_node_ids":[2137411342,2787984105],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3107620999,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3389/fpsyg.2020.584869"},"title":"a hybrid human neurorobotics approach to primary intersubjectivity via active inference","year":2020,"published_date":null,"journal":"Frontiers in Psychology","abstract":"Interdisciplinary efforts from developmental psychology, phenomenology, and philosophy of mind, have studied the rudiments of social cognition and conceptualized distinct forms of intersubjective communication and interaction at human early life. Interaction theorists consider primary intersubjectivity a non-mentalist, pre-theoretical, non-conceptual sort of processes that ground a certain level of communication and understanding, and provide support to higher-level cognitive skills. We argue the study of human/neural-robot interaction consists in a unique opportunity to deepen understanding of underlying mechanisms in social cognition through synthetic modeling, while allowing to examine a second person experiential (2PP) access to intersubjectivity in embodied dyadic interaction. Concretely, we propose the study of primary intersubjectivity as a 2PP experience characterized by predictive engagement, where perception, cognition, and action are accounted for an hermeneutic circle in dyadic interaction. From our interpretation of the concept of active inference in free-energy principle theory, we propose an open-source methodology named neural robotics library (NRL) for experimental human/neural-robot interaction, wherein a demonstration program named virtual Cartesian robot (VCBot) provides an opportunity to experience the aforementioned embodied interaction to general audiences. Lastly, through a study case, we discuss some ways human-robot intersubjectivity can contribute to cognitive science research, such as to the fields of developmental psychology, educational technology, and cognitive rehabilitation.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Hendry Ferreira Chame","author_id":2985947231,"num_publications":4,"num_citations":15,"affiliation_name":"Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Ahmadreza Ahmadi","author_id":2604660638,"num_publications":22,"num_citations":188,"affiliation_name":"KAIST","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Jun Tani","author_id":1989802913,"num_publications":286,"num_citations":4861,"affiliation_name":"Waseda University","sequence_number":3}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3107620999,"node_type":"seed","size":1650,"connected_edge_ids":["3107620999-2024149692","3107620999-2093466600","3107620999-2004652753","3107620999-2558206955","3107620999-2564601941","3107620999-2793764002"],"connected_node_ids":[2024149692,2093466600,2004652753,2558206955,2564601941,2793764002],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3108742966,"pmid":"33253028","pmcid":null,"doi":"10.1162/neco_a_01341"},"title":"Deeply Felt Affect: The Emergence of Valence in Deep Active Inference","year":2020,"published_date":null,"journal":"Neural Computation","abstract":"The positive-negative axis of emotional valence has long been recognized as fundamental to adaptive behavior, but its origin and underlying function have largely eluded formal theorizing and computational modeling. Using deep active inference, a hierarchical inference scheme that rests on inverting a model of how sensory data are generated, we develop a principled Bayesian model of emotional valence. This formulation asserts that agents infer their valence state based on the expected precision of their action model-an internal estimate of overall model fitness (\"subjective fitness\"). This index of subjective fitness can be estimated within any environment and exploits the domain generality of second-order beliefs (beliefs about beliefs). We show how maintaining internal valence representations allows the ensuing affective agent to optimize confidence in action selection preemptively. Valence representations can in turn be optimized by leveraging the (Bayes-optimal) updating term for subjective fitness, which we label affective charge (AC). AC tracks changes in fitness estimates and lends a sign to otherwise unsigned divergences between predictions and outcomes. We simulate the resulting affective inference by subjecting an in silico affective agent to a T-maze paradigm requiring context learning, followed by context reversal. This formulation of affective inference offers a principled account of the link between affect, (mental) action, and implicit metacognition. It characterizes how a deep biological system can infer its affective state and reduce uncertainty about such inferences through internal action (i.e., top-down modulation of priors that underwrite confidence). Thus, we demonstrate the potential of active inference to provide a formal and computationally tractable account of affect. Our demonstration of the face validity and potential utility of this formulation represents the first step within a larger research program. Next, this model can be leveraged to test the hypothesized role of valence by fitting the model to behavioral and neuronal responses.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Casper Hesp","author_id":2738228798,"num_publications":27,"num_citations":368,"affiliation_name":"University of Amsterdam","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Ryan Smith","author_id":2238016832,"num_publications":130,"num_citations":1866,"affiliation_name":"McGovern Institute for Brain Research","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Ryan C.

Given their ubiquity, we are concerned with distributed forms of representation (e.g., population codes), whereby patterns of ensemble activity in living tissue come to represent the causes of sensory input or data. The active inference framework rests on the Markov blanket formalism, which allows us to partition systems of interest, such as biological systems, into internal states, external states, and the blanket (active and sensory) states that render internal and external states conditionally independent of each other. In this framework, the representational capacity of living creatures emerges as a consequence of their Markovian structure and nonequilibrium dynamics, which together entail a dual-aspect information geometry. This entails a modest representational capacity: internal states have an intrinsic information geometry that describes their trajectory over time in state space, as well as an extrinsic information geometry that allows internal states to encode (the parameters of) probabilistic beliefs about (fictive) external states. Building on this, we describe here how, in an automatic and emergent manner, information about stimuli can come to be encoded by groups of neurons bound by a Markov blanket; what is known as the neuronal packet hypothesis. As a concrete demonstration of this type of emergent representation, we present numerical simulations showing that self-organizing ensembles of active inference agents sharing the right kind of probabilistic generative model are able to encode recoverable information about a stimulus array.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Maxwell J.

Stress can worsen parenting by potentiating problems that can impair intersubjectivity, e.g., problems of \"over-mentalizing\" (misattribution of the child's behaviors) and \"under-coupling\" (inadequate child-oriented mirroring). Previously we have developed Mom Power (MP) parenting intervention to promote maternal intersubjectivity and reduce parenting stress. This study aimed to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying the effects of MP with a novel Child Face Mirroring Task (CFMT) in functional magnetic-resonance-imaging settings. In CFMT, the participants responded to own and other's child's facial pictures in three task conditions: 1) empathic mirroring (Join), 2) non-mirroring observing (Observe), and 3) voluntary responding (React). In each condition, each child's neutral, ambiguous, distressed, and joyful expressions were repeatedly displayed. We examined the CFMT-related neural responses in a sample of healthy mothers (n=45) in Study 1, and MP effects on CFMT with a pre-intervention (T1) and post-intervention (T2) design in two groups, MP (n=19) and Control (n=17), in Study 2. We found that, from T1 to T2, MP (vs. Control) decreased parenting stress, decreased dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) during own-child-specific voluntary responding (React to Own vs. Other's Child), and increased activity in the frontoparietal cortices, midbrain, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala during own-child-specific empathic mirroring (Join vs. Observe of Own vs. Other's Child). We identified that MP effects on parenting stress were potentially mediated by T1-to-T2 changes in: 1) the left superior-temporal-gyrus differential responses in the contrast of Join vs. Observe of own (vs. other's) child, 2) the dmPFC-PAG (periaqueductal gray) differential functional connectivity in the same contrast, and 3) the left amygdala differential responses in the contrast of Join vs. Observe of own (vs. other's) child's joyful vs. distressed expressions. We discussed these results in support of the notion that MP reduces parenting stress via changing neural activities related to the problems of \"over-mentalizing\" and \"under-coupling\". Additionally, we discussed theoretical relationships between parenting stress and intersubjectivity in a novel dyadic active inference framework in a two-agent system to guide future research.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"S.

Importantly, using routine behaviour or making choices beneficial only at short time scales would prevent one from attaining these goals. During the past two decades, researchers have proposed various computational cognitive models that successfully account for behaviour related to cognitive control in a wide range of laboratory tasks. As humans operate in a dynamic and uncertain environment, making elaborate plans and integrating experience over multiple time scales is computationally expensive. Importantly, it remains poorly understood how uncertain consequences at different time scales are integrated into adaptive decisions. Here, we pursue the idea that cognitive control can be cast as active inference over a hierarchy of time scales, where inference, i.e., planning, at higher levels of the hierarchy controls inference at lower levels. We introduce the novel concept of meta-control states, which link higher-level beliefs with lower-level policy inference. Specifically, we conceptualize cognitive control as inference over these meta-control states, where solutions to cognitive control dilemmas emerge through surprisal minimisation at different hierarchy levels. We illustrate this concept using the exploration-exploitation dilemma based on a variant of a restless multi-armed bandit task. We demonstrate that beliefs about contexts and meta-control states at a higher level dynamically modulate the balance of exploration and exploitation at the lower level of a single action. Finally, we discuss the generalisation of this meta-control concept to other control dilemmas.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Dimitrije Markovic","author_id":2509163039,"num_publications":46,"num_citations":734,"affiliation_name":"Dresden University of Technology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas Goschke","author_id":2269532133,"num_publications":153,"num_citations":5685,"affiliation_name":"Dresden University of Technology","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Stefan J.

According to a Buddhist notion “if you want others to be happy, practice compassion; if you want to be happy, practice compassion,” compassion practice is an intervention to cultivate conflict-proof well-being. Here, compassion practice refers to a form of concentrated meditation wherein a practitioner attunes to friend, enemy, and someone in between, thinking, “I’m going to help them (equally).” The compassion meditation is based on Buddhist philosophy that mental suffering is rooted in conceptual thoughts that give rise to generic mental images of self and others and subsequent biases to preserve one's egoism, blocking the ultimate nature of mind. To contextualize compassion meditation scientifically, we adopted a Bayesian active inference framework to incorporate relevant Buddhist concepts, including mind (buddhi), compassion (karuna), aggregates (skandhas), suffering (duhkha), reification (samaropa), conceptual thoughts (vikalpa), and superimposition (prapanca). In this framework, a person is considered a Bayesian Engine that actively constructs phenomena based on the aggregates of forms, sensations, discriminations, actions, and consciousness. When the person embodies rigid beliefs about self and others’ identities (identity-grasping beliefs) and the resulting ego-preserving bias, the person's Bayesian Engine malfunctions, failing to use prediction errors to update prior beliefs. To counter this problem, after recognizing the causes of sufferings, a practitioner of the compassion meditation aims to attune to all others equally, friends and enemies alike, suspend identity-based conceptual thoughts, and eventually let go of any identity-grasping belief and ego-preserving bias that obscure reality. We present a brain model for the Bayesian Engine of three components: a) Relation-Modeling, b) Reality-Checking, and c) Conflict-Alarming, which are subserved by a) the Default-Mode Network (DMN), b) Frontoparietal Network (FPN) and Ventral Attention Network (VAN), and c) Salience Network (SN), respectively. Upon perceiving conflicts, the strengthening or weakening of ego-preserving bias will critically depend on whether the SN up-regulates the DMN or FPN/VAN, respectively. We propose that compassion meditation can strengthen brain regions that are conducive for suspending prior beliefs and enhancing the attunements to the counterparts in conflicts.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"S.

This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first paper that explains the emergence of cooperation and social rules through the surprise minimization framework. Our conceptual analysis shows under which circumstances cooperation becomes likely and when not. We further show that in social decision-making, surprise minimization is superior in many aspects to the classical approach of maximizing utility. Finally, we show that surprise minimization – but not classical utility maximization – can be used to explain why policy makers who carefully balance utility maximization and freedom of choice can reduce toxic, disease-causing stress in human societies. In this interdisciplinary research field, we include concepts from computational neuroscience, psychology, sociology and medicine to apply them in the multi-agent setup and explain cooperative aspects in social behavior.

A significant development in the former is the idea that we can frame brain function as a process of (active) inference, in which the nervous system makes predictions about its sensory data. These predictions depend upon an implicit predictive (generative) model used by the brain. This means neural dynamics can be framed as generating actions to ensure sensations are consistent with these predictions-and adjusting predictions when they are not. We illustrate the significance of this formulation for clinical neurology through simulating a clinical examination of the motor system; i.e. an upper limb coordination task. Specifically, we show how tendon reflexes emerge naturally under the right kind of generative model. Through simulated perturbations, pertaining to prior probabilities of this model's variables, we illustrate the emergence of hyperreflexia and pendular reflexes, reminiscent of neurological lesions in the corticospinal tract and cerebellum. We then turn to the computational lesions causing hypokinesia and deficits of coordination. This in silico lesion-deficit analysis provides an opportunity to revisit classic neurological dichotomies (e.g. pyramidal versus extrapyramidal systems) from the perspective of modern approaches to theoretical neurobiology-and our understanding of the neurocomputational architecture of movement control based on first principles.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Jakub Limanowski","author_id":3137403271,"num_publications":3,"num_citations":17,"affiliation_name":"Dresden University of Technology","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Jakub Limanowski","author_id":2040021002,"num_publications":27,"num_citations":676,"affiliation_name":"Dresden University of Technology","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Vishal Rawji","author_id":2746704325,"num_publications":26,"num_citations":260,"affiliation_name":"UCL Institute of Neurology","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Karl J.

This paper asks what blackboard role the thalamus might play, and whether that role is consistent with the neuroanatomy of the thalamus. It does so in a context of Bayesian belief updating, expressed as a Free Energy Principle. We suggest that the thalamus-as-a-blackboard offers important questions for research in spatial cognition. Several prominent features of the thalamus – including its lack of olfactory relay function, its lack of internal excitatory connections, its regular and conserved shape, its inhibitory interneurons, triadic synapses, and diffuse cortical connectivity – are consistent with a blackboard role. Different thalamic nuclei may play different blackboard roles: (1) The Pulvinar, through its reciprocal connections to posterior cortical regions, coordinates perceptual inference about ‘what is where’ from multi-sensory data. (2) The Mediodorsal nucleus, through its connections to prefrontal cortex, and the other thalamic nuclei linked to the motor cortex, uses the same generative model for planning and learning novel spatial movements. (3) The paraventricular nucleus may compute risk-reward trade-offs. We also propose that as any new movement is practiced a few times, cortico-thalamo-cortical links entrain the corresponding cortico-cortical links, through a process akin to supervised learning. Subsequently, the movement becomes a fast unconscious habit, not requiring the MD nucleus or other thalamic nuclei, and bypassing the thalamic bottleneck.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Robert Worden","author_id":3135500266,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":0,"affiliation_name":"University College London","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Max S.

In these cases, the robot first needs to actively query multiple observations and accumulate information before it can complete a task. In this paper, we cast this problem of active vision as active inference, which states that an intelligent agent maintains a generative model of its environment and acts in order to minimize its surprise, or expected free energy according to this model. We apply this to an object-reaching task for a 7-DOF robotic manipulator with an in-hand camera to scan the workspace. A novel generative model using deep neural networks is proposed that is able to fuse multiple views into an abstract representation and is trained from data by minimizing variational free energy. We validate our approach experimentally for a reaching task in simulation in which a robotic agent starts without any knowledge about its workspace. Each step, the next view pose is chosen by evaluating the expected free energy. We find that by minimizing the expected free energy, exploratory behavior emerges when the target object to reach is not in view, and the end effector is moved to the correct reach position once the target is located. Similar to an owl scavenging for prey, the robot naturally prefers higher ground for exploring, approaching its target once located.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Toon Van de Maele","author_id":3088732028,"num_publications":5,"num_citations":12,"affiliation_name":"Ghent University","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Tim Verbelen","author_id":1192672773,"num_publications":106,"num_citations":1213,"affiliation_name":"IMEC","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Ozan Çatal","author_id":2935739949,"num_publications":24,"num_citations":92,"affiliation_name":"Ghent University","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Cedric De Boom","author_id":2287307189,"num_publications":44,"num_citations":346,"affiliation_name":"Ghent University","sequence_number":4},{"name":"Bart Dhoedt","author_id":3216895213,"num_publications":44,"num_citations":192,"affiliation_name":"Ghent University","sequence_number":5},{"name":"Bart Dhoedt","author_id":1990677562,"num_publications":607,"num_citations":6485,"affiliation_name":"Information Technology University","sequence_number":5}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3134399927,"node_type":"seed","size":1700,"connected_edge_ids":["3134399927-2782189646","3134399927-3098317736","3134399927-2055789905","3134399927-2904920389","3134399927-3103942687","3134399927-2463330366","3134399927-2424475825","3134399927-3096632469"],"connected_node_ids":[2782189646,3098317736,2055789905,2904920389,3103942687,2463330366,2424475825,3096632469],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3135899442,"pmid":"33673663","pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/e23030293"},"title":"A Technical Critique of Some Parts of the Free Energy Principle.","year":2021,"published_date":null,"journal":"Entropy","abstract":"We summarize the original formulation of the free energy principle and highlight some technical issues.

We show further that this free energy lemma, when it does hold, implies the equality of variational density and ergodic conditional density. The interpretation in terms of Bayesian inference hinges on this point, and we hence conclude that it is not sufficiently justified. Additionally, we highlight that the variational densities presented in newer formulations of the free energy principle and lemma are parametrised by different variables than in older works, leading to a substantially different interpretation of the theory.

The dynamics of neural signals and their relations with information processing continue to be investigated through different measures in a variety of noteworthy studies. The brain entropy of spontaneous neural activity decreases during states of reduced consciousness. This evidence has been showed in primary consciousness states, such as psychedelic states, under the name of “the entropic brain hypothesis”. In this manuscript we propose an extension of this hypothesis to physiological and pathological aging. We review this particular facet of the complexity of the brain, mentioning studies that have investigated brain entropy in primary consciousness states, and extending this view to the field of neuroaging with a focus on resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging. We first introduce historic and conceptual ideas about entropy and neural complexity, treating the mindbrain as a complex nonlinear dynamic adaptive system, in light of the free energy principle. Then, we review the studies in this field, analyzing the idea that the aim of the neurocognitive system is to maintain a dynamic state of balance between order and chaos, both in terms of dynamics of neural signals and functional connectivity. In our exploration we will review studies both on acute psychedelic states and more chronic psychotic states and traits, such as those in schizophrenia, in order to show the increase of entropy in those states. Then we extend our exploration to physiological and pathological aging, where brain entropy is reduced. Finally, we propose an interpretation of these results, defining a general trend of brain entropy in primary states and cognitive aging.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Filippo Cieri","author_id":1970196903,"num_publications":15,"num_citations":243,"affiliation_name":"Lou Ruvo Brain Institute","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Filippo Cieri","author_id":3201485471,"num_publications":5,"num_citations":35,"affiliation_name":"Lou Ruvo Brain Institute","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Xiaowei Zhuang","author_id":2553186974,"num_publications":35,"num_citations":281,"affiliation_name":"Lou Ruvo Brain Institute","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Jessica Z.K.

While fascinating in its own right, it is also an important model for sensorimotor networks in general. A prominent approach to studying this system is active inference—which assumes the brain makes use of an internal (generative) model to predict proprioceptive and visual input. This approach treats action as ensuring sensations conform to predictions (i.e., by moving the eyes) and posits that visual percepts are the consequence of updating predictions to conform to sensations. Under active inference, the challenge is to identify the form of the generative model that makes these predictions—and thus directs behaviour. In this paper, we provide an overview of the generative models that the brain must employ to engage in active vision. This means specifying the processes that explain retinal cell activity and proprioceptive information from oculomotor muscle fibres. In addition to the mechanics of the eyes and retina, these processes include our choices about where to move our eyes. These decisions rest upon beliefs about salient locations, or the potential for information gain and belief-updating. A key theme of this paper is the relationship between ‘looking’ and ‘seeing’ under the brain’s implicit generative model of the visual world.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":3159577960,"num_publications":9,"num_citations":64,"affiliation_name":"UCL Institute of Neurology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":3185102216,"num_publications":9,"num_citations":64,"affiliation_name":"UCL Institute of Neurology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Noor Sajid","author_id":2975983068,"num_publications":27,"num_citations":252,"affiliation_name":"UCL Institute of Neurology","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Lancelot Da Costa","author_id":3000924792,"num_publications":23,"num_citations":263,"affiliation_name":"Imperial College London","sequence_number":3},{"name":"M.

To treat the brain to induce the desired functionality, formulation of a self-restoration process is necessary for optimal brain control. This study proposes a computational model for the brain's self-restoration process following the free-energy and degeneracy principles. Based on this model, a computational framework for brain control is established. We posited that the pre-treatment brain circuit has long been configured in response to the environmental (the other neural populations') demands on the circuit. Since the demands persist even after treatment, the treated circuit's response to the demand may gradually approximate the pre-treatment functionality. In this framework, an energy landscape of regional activities, estimated from resting-state endogenous activities by a pairwise maximum entropy model, is used to represent the pre-treatment functionality. The approximation of the pre-treatment functionality occurs via reconfiguration of interactions among neural populations within the treated circuit. To establish the current framework's construct validity, we conducted various simulations.

It specifies neuronal dynamics for state-estimation in terms of a descent on (variational) free energy -- a measure of the fit between an internal (generative) model and sensory observations. The free energy gradient is a prediction error -- plausibly encoded in the average membrane potentials of neuronal populations. Conversely, the expected probability of a state can be expressed in terms of neuronal firing rates. We show that this is consistent with current models of neuronal dynamics and establish face validity by synthesising plausible electrophysiological responses. We then show that these neuronal dynamics approximate natural gradient descent, a well-known optimisation algorithm from information geometry that follows the steepest descent of the objective in information space. We compare the information length of belief updating in both schemes, a measure of the distance traveled in information space that has a direct interpretation in terms of metabolic cost. We show that neural dynamics under active inference are metabolically efficient and suggest that neural representations in biological agents may evolve by approximating steepest descent in information space towards the point of optimal inference.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Lancelot Da Costa","author_id":3000924792,"num_publications":23,"num_citations":263,"affiliation_name":"Imperial College London","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Biswa Sengupta","author_id":2581944660,"num_publications":61,"num_citations":2173,"affiliation_name":"York University","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Karl J.

So far, these advances have largely taken the form of correlations between specific aspects of inflammation (e.g. blood plasma levels of inflammatory markers, genetic mutations in immune pathways, viral or bacterial infection) with the development of neuropsychiatric conditions such as autism, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and depression. A fundamental question remains open: why are psychiatric disorders and immune responses intertwined? To address this would require a step back from a historical mind-body dualism that has created such a dichotomy. We propose three contributions of active inference when addressing this question: translation, unification, and simulation. To illustrate these contributions, we consider the following questions. Is there an immunological analogue of sensory attenuation? Is there a common generative model that the brain and immune system jointly optimise? Can the immune response and psychiatric illness both be explained in terms of self-organising systems responding to threatening stimuli in their external environment, whether those stimuli happen to be pathogens, predators, or people?

However, research is hindered by conceptual confusion, concerns surrounding domain specificity, and an inability to distinguish sensory (bottom-up) and expectation driven (top-down) interoceptive processes. A paradigm was therefore developed from an active inference perspective. Novel indices were computed and examined in those with alexithymia: a personality associated with interoceptive deficits and disordered eating. The paradigm successfully identified individuals driven by sensations rather than expectations: alexithymia was characterized by attenuated prior precision (a larger divergence between pre-prandial and post-prandial satiety, and low expectation confidence), and increased prediction error (a higher correlation between changes in hunger and blood glucose, and greater rebound hunger after a sensory incongruent drink). In addition, those with a higher BMI were less confident and had a larger anticipated satiety divergence. These findings demonstrate the need to move beyond existing paradigms such as the Satiety Quotient and Heartbeat Counting Task which may have limited our understanding of eating behaviour.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Hayley A.

To deepen understanding of these interactions, we present a computational (active inference) model of CBT that allows formal simulations of interactions between cognitive interventions (i.e., cognitive restructuring) and behavioral interventions (i.e., exposure) in producing adaptive behavior change (i.e., reducing maladaptive avoidance behavior). Using spider phobia as a concrete example of maladaptive avoidance more generally, we show simulations indicating that when conscious beliefs about safety/danger have strong interactions with affective/behavioral outcomes, behavioral change during exposure therapy is mediated by changes in these beliefs, preventing generalization. In contrast, when these interactions are weakened, and cognitive restructuring only induces belief uncertainty (as opposed to strong safety beliefs), behavior change leads to generalized learning (i.e., \"over-writing\" the implicit beliefs about action-outcome mappings that directly produce avoidance). The individual is therefore equipped to face any new context, safe or dangerous, remaining in a content state without the need for avoidance behavior-increasing resilience from a CBT perspective. These results show how the same changes in behavior during CBT can be due to distinct underlying mechanisms; they predict lower rates of relapse when cognitive interventions focus on inducing uncertainty and on reducing the effects of automatic negative thoughts on behavior.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Ryan Smith","author_id":2238016832,"num_publications":130,"num_citations":1866,"affiliation_name":"McGovern Institute for Brain Research","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Michael Moutoussis","author_id":2558443771,"num_publications":121,"num_citations":2496,"affiliation_name":"Murphy Oil","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Edda Bilek","author_id":2155552747,"num_publications":26,"num_citations":550,"affiliation_name":"Heidelberg University","sequence_number":3}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3161563022,"node_type":"seed","size":1775,"connected_edge_ids":["3161563022-2123611655","3161563022-2960216878","3161563022-2770517318","3161563022-2789196295","3161563022-2623066203","3161563022-2208959019","3161563022-3026687585","3161563022-3108742966","3161563022-2992533179","3161563022-2128918015","3161563022-2901597764"],"connected_node_ids":[2123611655,2960216878,2770517318,2789196295,2623066203,2208959019,3026687585,3108742966,2992533179,2128918015,2901597764],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3167831847,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/e23060707"},"title":"Information and Self-Organization II: Steady State and Phase Transition.","year":2021,"published_date":"2021-06-02","journal":"Entropy","abstract":"This paper starts from Schrodinger’s famous question “what is life” and elucidates answers that invoke, in particular, Friston’s free energy principle and its relation to the method of Bayesian inference and to Synergetics 2nd foundation that utilizes Jaynes’ maximum entropy principle.

To date, however, formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description of the relationship between local-scale interactions between autonomous sub-system components (individuals) and global-scale behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper we use the Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of any non-equilibrium steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal agent-based model that simulates the relationship between local individual-level interaction and collective intelligence. We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF agents (Model 1) with specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model 2), Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4). These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive ability are motivated by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist and flourish in an environment populated by other highly autonomous AIF agents, and have also recently been shown to map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise cognitive transitions increase system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for alignment between agents’ local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the dynamics of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed exogenously by incentives to agents’ behaviors (contra existing computational models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors for collective behavior (contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light on the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective intelligence in human and other complex adaptive systems.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Rafael Kaufmann","author_id":3144635321,"num_publications":2,"num_citations":1,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1},{"name":"Pranav Gupta","author_id":3177468805,"num_publications":10,"num_citations":22,"affiliation_name":"Carnegie Mellon University","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Jacob Taylor","author_id":3167066425,"num_publications":6,"num_citations":33,"affiliation_name":"University of Oxford","sequence_number":3}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3173338947,"node_type":"seed","size":1800,"connected_edge_ids":["3173338947-2463330366","3173338947-2137411342","3173338947-2004652753","3173338947-2989729815","3173338947-3012959192","3173338947-2484983710","3173338947-2909444209","3173338947-2024149692","3173338947-2908555537","3173338947-2055789905","3173338947-2754844655","3173338947-2933899145","3173338947-2783657280"],"connected_node_ids":[2463330366,2137411342,2004652753,2989729815,3012959192,2484983710,2909444209,2024149692,2908555537,2055789905,2754844655,2933899145,2783657280],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3173571222,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3389/fnbeh.2021.647732"},"title":"Active Inferants: An Active Inference Framework for Ant Colony Behavior.","year":2021,"published_date":"2021-06-24","journal":"Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience","abstract":"In this paper, we introduce an active inference model of ant colony foraging behavior, and implement the model in a series of in silico experiments.

The context in which social interactions take place is crucial for mental state attribution as sensory inputs may be perceived differently depending on the context. In this paper, we introduce a mental state attribution task where a target-face with either an ambiguous or an unambiguous emotion is embedded in different social contexts. The social context is determined by the emotions conveyed by other faces in the scene. This task involves mental state attribution to a target-face (either happy or sad) depending on the social context. Using active inference models, we provide a proof of concept that an agent's perception of sensory stimuli may be altered by social context. We show with simulations that context congruency and facial expression coherency improve behavioural performance in terms of decision times. Furthermore, we show through simulations that the abnormal viewing strategies employed by patients with schizophrenia may be due to (i) an imbalance between the precisions of local and global features in the scene and (ii) a failure to modulate the sensory precision to contextualise emotions.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"M.

We argue that the mental alignment account should be rejected because it neglects the action-oriented nature of cooperative communication, which skews its view of the dynamics of communicative interaction. We introduce our own conception of cooperative communication, inspired by a more radical ecological interpretation of the active inference framework. Cooperative communication, on our ecological conception, serves to guide and constrain the dynamics of the cooperative interaction via the construction and restructuring of shared fields of affordances, in order to reach the local goals of the joint actions in which episodes of cooperative communication are embedded.

At his time, Freud in his “Project for a Scientific Psychology” searched for a model of the brain that could relate to incorporate the psyche’s topography and dynamic. Current neuropsychoanalysis builds on specific functions as investigated in Affective and Cognitive (and Social) Neuroscience including embodied approaches. The brain’s various functions are often converged with prediction as operationalized in predictive coding (PC) and Free energy principle (FEP) which, recently, have been conceived as core for a “New Project for Scientific Psychology”. We propose to search for a yet more comprehensive and holistic neuroscience that focuses primarily on its topography and dynamic analogous to Freud’s model of the psyche. This leads us to what we describe as “Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” that focuses on the spatial topography and temporal dynamic of the brain’s neural activity including how they shape affective, cognitive, and social functions including PC and FEP (first part). That is illustrated by the temporally and spatially nested neural hierarchy of the self in the brain’s neural activity (second and third part). This sets the ground for developing our proposed “Project for a Spatiotemporal Neuroscience”, which complements and extends both Freud’s and Solms’ projects (fourth part) and also carries major practical implications as it lays the ground for a novel form of neuroscientifically informed psychotherapy, namely “ Spatiotemporal Psychotherapy”. In conclusion, “Spatiotemporal Neuroscience” provides an intimate link of brain and psyche by showing topography and dynamic as their shared features, i.e., “common currency”.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Georg Northoff","author_id":1288706717,"num_publications":666,"num_citations":20769,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1},{"name":"Andrea Scalabrini","author_id":2651054086,"num_publications":26,"num_citations":194,"affiliation_name":"University of Chieti-Pescara","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3205330117,"node_type":"seed","size":1550,"connected_edge_ids":["3205330117-2623066203","3205330117-2122458046"],"connected_node_ids":[2623066203,2122458046],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3205508925,"pmid":"34645899","pmcid":"8514518","doi":"10.1038/s41598-021-99864-y"},"title":"An examination of active inference in autistic adults using immersive virtual reality.","year":2021,"published_date":"2021-10-13","journal":"Scientific Reports","abstract":"The integration of prior expectations, sensory information, and environmental volatility is proposed to be atypical in Autism Spectrum Disorder, yet few studies have tested these predictive processes in active movement tasks. To address this gap in the research, we used an immersive virtual-reality racquetball paradigm to explore how visual sampling behaviours and movement kinematics are adjusted in relation to unexpected, uncertain, and volatile changes in environmental statistics. We found that prior expectations concerning ball ‘bounciness’ affected sensorimotor control in both autistic and neurotypical participants, with all individuals using prediction-driven gaze strategies to track the virtual ball. However, autistic participants showed substantial differences in visuomotor behaviour when environmental conditions were more volatile. Specifically, uncertainty-related performance difficulties in these conditions were accompanied by atypical movement kinematics and visual sampling responses.

Hence, trust is a necessary condition for human-robot collaboration (HRC). However, and despite its crucial role, it is still largely unknown how trust emerges, develops, and supports human relationship to technological systems. In the following paper we review the literature on trust, human-robot interaction, HRC, and human interaction at large. Early models of trust suggest that it is a trade-off between benevolence and competence; while studies of human to human interaction emphasize the role of shared behavior and mutual knowledge in the gradual building of trust. We go on to introduce a model of trust as an agent' best explanation for reliable sensory exchange with an extended motor plant or partner. This model is based on the cognitive neuroscience of active inference and suggests that, in the context of HRC, trust can be casted in terms of virtual control over an artificial agent. Interactive feedback is a necessary condition to the extension of the trustor's perception-action cycle. This model has important implications for understanding human-robot interaction and collaboration-as it allows the traditional determinants of human trust, such as the benevolence and competence attributed to the trustee, to be defined in terms of hierarchical active inference, while vulnerability can be described in terms of information exchange and empowerment. Furthermore, this model emphasizes the role of user feedback during HRC and suggests that boredom and surprise may be used in personalized interactions as markers for under and over-reliance on the system. The description of trust as a sense of virtual control offers a crucial step toward grounding human factors in cognitive neuroscience and improving the design of human-centered technology. Furthermore, we examine the role of shared behavior in the genesis of trust, especially in the context of dyadic collaboration, suggesting important consequences for the acceptability and design of human-robot collaborative systems.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Felix Schoeller","author_id":2981566388,"num_publications":30,"num_citations":195,"affiliation_name":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Mark Miller","author_id":3104382914,"num_publications":3,"num_citations":3,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":2},{"name":"Mark Miller","author_id":2998684661,"num_publications":9,"num_citations":42,"affiliation_name":"University of Sussex","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Roy Salomon","author_id":2125579522,"num_publications":82,"num_citations":1800,"affiliation_name":"Bar-Ilan University","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Roy Salomon","author_id":3154072955,"num_publications":2,"num_citations":1,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":3},{"name":"Karl J.

In order to improve the quality of care for patients with persistent physical and comorbid mental health conditions, person-centred care approaches addressing psychosocial factors are currently advocated. Central to successful person-centred care is a multidisciplinary collaboration between mental health and musculoskeletal specialists underpinned by a robust therapeutic alliance. Such a collaborative approach might be found in osteopathy, which is typically utilized to treat patients with musculoskeletal disorders but may arguably also benefit mental health outcomes. However, research and practice exploring the reputed effect of osteopathy on patients with mental health problems lack a robust framework. In this hypothesis and theory article, we build upon research from embodied cognition, predictive coding, interoception, and osteopathy to propose an embodied, predictive and interoceptive framework that underpins osteopathic person-centred care for individuals with persistent physical and comorbid mental health problems. Based on the premise that, for example, chronic pain and comorbid depression are underlined by overly precise predictions or imprecise sensory information, we hypothesize that osteopathic treatment may generate strong interoceptive prediction errors that update the generative model underpinning the experience of pain and depression. Thus, physical and mental symptoms may be reduced through active and perceptual inference. We discuss how these theoretical perspectives can inform future research into osteopathy and mental health to reduce the burden of comorbid psychological factors in patients with persistent physical symptoms and support person-centred multidisciplinary care in mental health.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Lucas Bohlen","author_id":3210908904,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":1,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1},{"name":"Robert Shaw","author_id":3041125539,"num_publications":4,"num_citations":5,"affiliation_name":"University of Technology, Sydney","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Francesco Cerritelli","author_id":3210729850,"num_publications":2,"num_citations":1,"affiliation_name":"University of Technology, Sydney","sequence_number":3},{"name":"Jorge E.

While this form of epilepsy has long been recognized as a temporal lobe epilepsy, we have accumulated evidence converging toward the location of the symptomatogenic zone in the dorsal anterior insula during the 10 last years. The neurocognitive hypothesis for the genesis of a mental clarity is the suppression of the interoceptive prediction errors and of the unexpected surprise associated with any incoming internal or external signal, usually processed by the dorsal anterior insula.

In this paper, we address the issue of machine understanding from the perspective of active inference. This paradigm enables decision making based upon a model of how data are generated. The generative model contains those variables required to explain sensory data, and its inversion may be seen as an attempt to explain the causes of these data. Here we are interested in explanations of one’s own actions. This implies a deep generative model that includes a model of the world, used to infer policies, and a higher-level model that attempts to predict which policies will be selected based upon a space of hypothetical (i.e., counterfactual) explanations—and which can subsequently be used to provide (retrospective) explanations about the policies pursued. We illustrate the construct validity of this notion of understanding in relation to human understanding, through highlighting the similarities in computational architecture and consequences of its dysfunction.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Thomas Parr","author_id":2969837637,"num_publications":125,"num_citations":2549,"affiliation_name":"Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Giovanni Pezzulo","author_id":2038907673,"num_publications":238,"num_citations":7635,"affiliation_name":"National Research Council","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3211802703,"node_type":"seed","size":1800,"connected_edge_ids":["3211802703-2534098824","3211802703-2992533179","3211802703-2765383588","3211802703-2787984105","3211802703-3108742966","3211802703-2123611655","3211802703-3017990858","3211802703-3134192892","3211802703-3083520193","3211802703-3096632469","3211802703-3155071252","3211802703-2033422410","3211802703-3042228302","3211802703-2606488938","3211802703-2782189646","3211802703-2948901522","3211802703-3095485376"],"connected_node_ids":[2534098824,2992533179,2765383588,2787984105,3108742966,2123611655,3017990858,3134192892,3083520193,3096632469,3155071252,2033422410,3042228302,2606488938,2782189646,2948901522,3095485376],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3215613533,"pmid":null,"pmcid":null,"doi":"10.3390/e23121619"},"title":"Affect-Logic, Embodiment, Synergetics, and the Free Energy Principle: New Approaches to the Understanding and Treatment of Schizophrenia","year":2021,"published_date":"2021-12-01","journal":"Entropy","abstract":"This theoretical paper explores the affect-logic approach to schizophrenia in light of the general complexity theories of cognition: embodied cognition, Haken’s synergetics, and Friston’s free energy principle. According to affect-logic, the mental apparatus is an embodied system open to its environment, driven by bioenergetic inputs of emotions. Emotions are rooted in goal-directed embodied states selected by evolutionary pressure for coping with specific situations such as fight, flight, attachment, and others. According to synergetics, nonlinear bifurcations and the emergence of new global patterns occur in open systems when control parameters reach a critical level. Applied to the emergence of psychotic states, synergetics and the proposed energetic understanding of emotions lead to the hypothesis that critical levels of emotional tension may be responsible for the transition from normal to psychotic modes of functioning in vulnerable individuals. In addition, the free energy principle through learning suggests that psychotic symptoms correspond to alternative modes of minimizing free energy, which then entails distorted perceptions of the body, self, and reality. This synthetic formulation has implications for novel therapeutic and preventive strategies in the treatment of psychoses, among these are milieu-therapeutic approaches of the Soteria type that focus on a sustained reduction of emotional tension and phenomenologically oriented methods for improving the perception of body, self, and reality.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Luc Ciompi","author_id":3216371988,"num_publications":1,"num_citations":1,"affiliation_name":null,"sequence_number":1},{"name":"Wolfgang Tschacher","author_id":86923291,"num_publications":223,"num_citations":4173,"affiliation_name":"University of Bern","sequence_number":2}],"co_citations":1300,"collection_tags":[],"id":3215613533,"node_type":"seed","size":1550,"connected_edge_ids":["3215613533-2943260997","3215613533-3167831847"],"connected_node_ids":[2943260997,3167831847],"cluster_id":1,"alternate_cluster_id":1},{"metadata":{"ident":{"id":3216964476,"pmid":"34819563","pmcid":"8613215","doi":"10.1038/s41598-021-02200-7"},"title":"Active strategies for multisensory conflict suppression in the virtual hand illusion.","year":2021,"published_date":"2021-11-24","journal":"Scientific Reports","abstract":"The perception of our body in space is flexible and manipulable. The predictive brain hypothesis explains this malleability as a consequence of the interplay between incoming sensory information and our body expectations. However, given the interaction between perception and action, we might also expect that actions would arise due to prediction errors, especially in conflicting situations. Here we describe a computational model, based on the free-energy principle, that forecasts involuntary movements in sensorimotor conflicts. We experimentally confirm those predictions in humans using a virtual reality rubber-hand illusion. Participants generated movements (forces) towards the virtual hand, regardless of its location with respect to the real arm, with little to no forces produced when the virtual hand overlaid their physical hand. The congruency of our model predictions and human observations indicates that the brain-body is generating actions to reduce the prediction error between the expected arm location and the new visual arm. This observed unconscious mechanism is an empirical validation of the perception-action duality in body adaptation to uncertain situations and evidence of the active component of predictive processing.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Pablo Lanillos","author_id":2562373974,"num_publications":60,"num_citations":680,"affiliation_name":"Radboud University Nijmegen","sequence_number":1},{"name":"Sae Franklin","author_id":2185315875,"num_publications":25,"num_citations":298,"affiliation_name":"Technische Universität München","sequence_number":2},{"name":"Antonella Maselli","author_id":3187218773,"num_publications":9,"num_citations":61,"affiliation_name":"Microsoft","sequence_number":3},{"name":"David W.

In this paper we show that Expected Free Energy (EFE) minimisation, a core feature of the framework, does not lead to purposeful explorative behaviour in linear Gaussian dynamical systems. We provide a simple proof that, due to the specific construction used for the EFE, the terms responsible for the exploratory (epistemic) drive become constant in the case of linear Gaussian systems. This renders AIF equivalent to KL control. From a theoretical point of view this is an interesting result since it is generally assumed that EFE minimisation will always introduce an exploratory drive in AIF agents. While the full EFE objective does not lead to exploration in linear Gaussian dynamical systems, the principles of its construction can still be used to design objectives that include an epistemic drive. We provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanics behind the epistemic drive of AIF agents and show how to design objectives for linear Gaussian dynamical systems that do include an epistemic drive. Concretely, we show that focusing solely on epistemics and dispensing with goal-directed terms leads to a form of maximum entropy exploration that is heavily dependent on the type of control signals driving the system. Additive controls do not permit such exploration. From a practical point of view this is an important result since linear Gaussian dynamical systems with additive controls are an extensively used model class, encompassing for instance Linear Quadratic Gaussian controllers. On the other hand, linear Gaussian dynamical systems driven by multiplicative controls such as switching transition matrices do permit an exploratory drive.","metrics":null,"volume":null,"issue":null,"first_page":null,"last_page":null},"authors":[{"name":"Magnus T.
